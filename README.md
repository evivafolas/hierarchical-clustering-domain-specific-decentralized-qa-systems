# Hierarchical Document Classification, Clustering and Management System, using NLP.

This is a Thesis project from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessalonki. Using NLP and deep learning models (eg. BERT and sentence-transformers), the system creates the means to classify given documents, based on given topics. Then classifies the documents and creates further topic models (either BERTopic or LDA, NNMF, etc.) to create similar document clusters.
