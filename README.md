## Abstract:
Information retrieval has always been a fundamental part of almost any task, therefore
as the world steadily increases its reliance on quick and accurate information retrieval,
it is only natural to focus on finding ways, with which one could leverage the power of
artificial intelligence in order to improve the question answering capabilities of a computer
system, rather than to stay reliant on more mature, merely probabilistic and statistical
methods.
In an era where data drives innovation and decision-making, the importance of structured
and organized data cannot be overstated. Structured data facilitates efficient information
retrieval, supports data-driven decision-making processes, and empowers artificial intelligence
and machine learning models.
The implementation of deep learning methods and techniques can gradually aid the
procedure to relieve us of our dependence on keywords and shift towards teaching a
computer to understand the semantic capacity of text documents and queries and use
that as a means of a more refined method of information retrieval. The former can
be aided in part by a fully autonomous system capable of organizing, managing and
classifying documents semantically with minimal training. Harnessing the capabilities and
profound versatility of zero and few-shot learning and classification, as well as modern
topic modelling techniques, one can develop an application that as an input receives raw
unlabelled and unprocessed data and returns a fully functioning information retrieval and
question-answering system.
In an effort to be versatile throughout its premise, within this research, the feasibility
and profitability of such a system being decentralized and domain-specific will be challenged
and assessed. As the end goal is structured data and efficient information retrieval,
the possibility of a system functioning within nodes that are separate from each other
but communicate implies its dependency on smaller less powerful and easier-to-maintain
systems, with less storage and computational requirements and therefore is a promising
hypothesis.
Through an assortment of benchmarks and tests the data supports the hypothesis
that such a system if planned and executed according to the problem at hand, could be
a better and more versatile solution.
