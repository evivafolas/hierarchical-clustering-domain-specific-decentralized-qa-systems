I have already called senators, legislators and the Governor demanding
that the warrants be unsealed, and that all involved in this atrocity
(including the President, Attorney General and Governor) be suspended
pending an investigation.

I seriously doubt, however, that anything will ever be done.

Yes.

(I am adamantly an environmentalist.  I will not use styrofoam table service.
Please keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack
environmentalism)

A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will
rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more
powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.

Satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something
other than God's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the
health of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You
think he's going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected,
it is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is
not God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is
God.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.

I see two facets of a response to it:

1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is
   God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because
   showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not
   constitute what the Apostle Paul called ""becoming all things to all men so
   that by all possible means I might save some.""

   Don't say ""Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time
   on."" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your
   credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.

2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not
   creator.  Show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and
   glory.  Show that it is not the ultimate tapestry, but one of many cords

 This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the 
 belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist.
 This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are
 conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have
 to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe
 in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at
 God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan
 except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond
 hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The 
 reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians
 have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.

 How did they shoot themselves in the foot?

  There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a 
  particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and
  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least
  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this
  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because
  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the
  russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict
  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant
  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists
  can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).

 Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist
 doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may
 just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:
 
 Strong atheism - ""I believe god does not exist""   a positive belief

 Weak atheism   - ""I don't believe in a god""       a negative belief
 
 these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of
 god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that
 you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)
 
 suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent
 as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas
 exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person
 not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that
 even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:
 
 christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god
 
 atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)
 
 atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set
 
 agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....)

 Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not
  will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always 
  prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival
  trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.

14,"Hello,

	I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have  
8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  
both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  
of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  
that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  
can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  
$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  
the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  
the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  
avoid...

So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  
well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  
$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  
do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  
extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  
ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  
probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly  
appreciated.

Mr. Bettman	The Guy in the Wrong Sport
Mr. Stein	The Guy Who Should Be In Charge But Isn't

Of course, we also need new names for the individual awards, and other
stuff like the President's Cup.

President's Cup		The Trophy Given To the Best Regular-Season Team
Hart winner		The Most Valuable Player, chosen from the
				Guys in the Middle, the Guys on the
				Right, the Guys on the Left, the Guys
				Back There, and the Guy in the Net,
				though typically given only to the
				Guys in the Middle and the Guys on 
				the Left and on the Right
Norris winner		The Best Guy in the back; or, the Guy who was
				awarded for something even though he
				is not one of the Guys in the Middle
				or on the Left or the Right

...ad nauseum.

According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri, Baerga had the
highest percentage of DPs turned in the league, while Alomar had the worst.
However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average.  So who would be better?

Using Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays)
Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs.
Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs.

Using Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays).
Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs.
Baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs.

Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a 
different SS.

Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar
has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on
Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall.

Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on
PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus.
(ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow)
Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when
compared to IDE?

I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.

IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's
how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be
an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different
platforms.

Is there any argument that 
IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the
drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able
to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because
of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?

If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to
perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main
memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE
can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored
in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives 
at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the
same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?

A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245
million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets
close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few
hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?

So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type,
considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or
tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and
run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives
at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years
ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that
prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.

But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you
get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have
a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI
choice really give them more performance than IDE?

>But, you bought your PC for

True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option
is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.

No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the
best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer
eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single
hard drive system?

With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that
PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are, 
is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/
partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?

So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this
really a problem?

After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers,
I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor
have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or
to/from the same drive.

That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that

However, when I run the program, I get the message:

Warning: No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion.

(Just like the manual sez).

I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way
to go about this:

    static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = {

            XtWidgetBaseOffset,

However, I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seems
to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it
says that I can add it to a widget's ""class_intialize"" function. HOW? What's
one of those? :-(

Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),

I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and
polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of
points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.

First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the
Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into
exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies
completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,
or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.

Now, the phrasing of this question says ""if a line intersects a polygon"", so
this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is
to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to
solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.

In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a
new language called PostScript.  (See ""PostScript Language"", by Adobe Systems
Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).

So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that
draws the line L and the polygon P, and then ""outputs"" the answer.  By
""output"", we mean the program executes a command called ""showpage"", which
actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick
examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus
the original problem.

There are two small problems with this approach. 

	(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the
	reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of
	Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of
	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.

	(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the
	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in
	other words, will it halt?

	Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a
	Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is
	undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn
	out to be undecidable.


I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite
precision and running out of ink, paper or both.

The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know
better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known
Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.
37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to
Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an
acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no
longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to
complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)

--------

From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)

Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict
yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its

37,"I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of
mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot
of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years
(since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from
painful experience:

  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.
     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more
     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.

  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear
     that these things will itch for months.

  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of
     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,
     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could
     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special
     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is
     required to get it.

  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old
     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall
     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers
     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I
     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some
     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.

  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.
     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally
     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is
     another preparation called ""Chig Away"" that is a combination of
     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was
     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In
     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get
     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we
     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They
     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur
     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)

  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget
     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment
     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone
     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine
     (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.
     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this
     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think
     it gains nothing).

  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved
     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery
     as well.

Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban
doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors
seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I
suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers

      One of the commentators on one of the Big Three news programs 
described the VAT (which ain't a sales tax) as a tax ""government's love.""
I was even surprised he got the reason right:  it effectively hides the
majority of the tax the consumer has to pay *from* the consumer.  It's
kind of like they do with cars.  You pay far more for automobile taxes than
most people realize because it's contained in two dozen different taxes,

Actuallay I don't, but on the other hand I don't support the idea of having
one newsgroup for every aspect of graphics programming as proposed by Brian,
in his reply to my original posting.
I would suggest a looser structure more like a comp.graphics.programmer,
comp.graphics.hw_and_sw
The reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you
say we shouldn't spilt up, not to get to few postings every day.
I takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or 
three I'm interested in.

I understand and agree when you say you want all aspects of graphics in one
meeting. I agree to some extension. I see news as a forum to exchange ideas,
help others or to be helped. I think this is difficult to achive if there
are so many different things in one meeting.

44,"I'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286, and
could use some feedback on a couple systems I'm looking at if anyone is
familiar with them.
 
        The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget 486/66 VLB
tower.  For about $2343 (delivered) it offers VLB, 8MB, 200MB IDE, a Mitsumi
CD-ROM (with software bundle), Media Vision Sound board, 14"" CTX 1468NI,
128K Cache, and the usual drives, ports, & OS software.  Since my budget is
$2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it
IS too good to be true, of course). Among other things, I've never seen a
review of the Budget systems (or their parent company, Micro Smart), or of
the motherboard they are using (the Aetana). Any feedback would be
appreciated.
 
        In a similar vein, the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro's
Elite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper (2MB) & Midwest Micro 14"" MI
monitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere.  I'm familiar with the
firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig

  I had the same problem.  At first, I thought it was the video driver and 
  made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most
  evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of
  experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA
  resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.
  
  My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It
  worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the 
  guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed
  a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.
  So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer
  one.

Hi,
It might be nice to know, what's possible on different hard ware platforms.
But usually the hard ware is fixed ( in my case either Unix or DOS- PC ).
So I'm not much interested in Amiga news. 

In the case of Software, I won't get any comercial software mentioned in this
newgroup to run on a Unix- platform, so I'm not interested in this information.

I would suggest to split the group. I don't see the problem of cross-posting.
Then you need to read just 2 newgroups with half the size. 

BUT WHAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A FAQ. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE
TRAFFIC A LOT.

Title: In the neighborhood of Hope, among the rubble

(Excerpts)

Mahmoud Jowara'r stared at me long and sadly: ""I worked my entire
life in order to built that house and this is what is left"". Only
TV could transmit the full sadness of his face. ""You say that we
teach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen
to a child who sees this ?"" And once again he wraps himself in a
lengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in
the field of rubble that was once his home. The term
'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of
what he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a
house and shreds of belongings.

Once again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday
there was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF
forces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles
and placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I
have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more
horrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of
houses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely
demolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more
brutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the
residents were still told to remove their valuables from their
homes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the
handcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied
with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to
stand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were
even allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just
gold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday,
some 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind
their backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants
on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their
hearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their
homes, one after the other.

The point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphone
scrambling system was discussed.  Incidentally, my MP has responded to
my questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved'
countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will
get A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with
A5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the
capabilities of the base station.

The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to
listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but 
cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users
and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular
calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another
base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled
call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's
equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can
listen without having to obtain a warrant.

But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant
to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see
above - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts,
but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a
warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge,
it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop
listening in'...

You have every reason to be scared shitless.  Take a look at the records
of McCarthy, Hoover (J. Edgar, not the cleaner - though they both excelled at
sucking) and Nixon.

Well, California voted overwhelmingly for change, right?
The argument to continue military programs just to support jobs is
a poor one. It's kept quite a few bases open that should have been closed
years ago, wasting billions of taxes.

I think that the Vincent is the wrong sort of bike for Satan to ride.
Honda have just brought out the CB1000 (look in BIKE Magazine) which
looks so evil that Satan would not hesitate to ride it.  17-hole DMs,
Levi 501s and a black bomber jacket.  I'm not sure about the helmet,

[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly
asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions
of general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate
crossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]

[last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,
    new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]

                Commonly Asked Questions

Radar Questions:

Q:  Where are radar detectors illegal?

A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit
    all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in
    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,
    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They
    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.
    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other
    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.

Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?

A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,
    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe
    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.
    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently
    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate
    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.
    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected
    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a
    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned
    on.

Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?

A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance
    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target
    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR
    system.

Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be
    able to handle it? 

A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US
    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a
    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the
    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the
    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.
    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low
    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar
    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,
    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such
    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use
    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:
    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they
    are used (or else, don't speed.)

Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?

A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.
    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.
    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the
    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the
    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.

Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:

Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?

A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a
    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)
    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to
    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they
    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',
    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)
    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that
    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into
    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle
    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance
    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing
    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle
    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or
    spinning.

    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car
    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the
    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling
    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to
    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle
    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater
    slip angle than the front wheels.

Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?

A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear
   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally
   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop
   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle
   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to
   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.

Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?

A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while
   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot
   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you
   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to
   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;
   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side
   on the throttle.

   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the
   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing
   the same thing.

Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?

A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of
   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for
   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the
   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with
   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch
   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission
   speed up.

   The procedure is as follows:
   (0) declutch
   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral
   (2) engage clutch
   (3) match revs
   (4) declutch
   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear
   (6) engage clutch

   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.
   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the
   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or
   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.
   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at
   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good
   condition.

Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and
   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?

A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and
   2) almost never.

   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times
   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the
   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine
   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite
   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from
   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*
   major) part of the equation.

   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really
   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically
   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the
   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.
   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads
   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply
   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.

   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the
   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced
   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the
   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making
   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end
   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car
   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'
   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of
   caveats could go on for page after page.

Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according
   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate
   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?

A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.

   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics
   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,
   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a
   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating
   temperature.

   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser
   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a
   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been
   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match
   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire
   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses
   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling
   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire
   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will
   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its
   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some
   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like
   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.
   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal
   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of
   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)

   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,
   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters
   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than
   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible
   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of
   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques
   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.

You'll have fun looking for the rear-end gears on an SHO--the Taurus
is a front-wheel-drive vehicle...

I went back and checked the article again; The SHO Wagon is quicker
than the SHO automatic, but significantly slower than the REAL SHO.

Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me; if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers. That is not to
say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick (eg
disabled persons), but they aren't in any position to use an
SHO anyway. 

I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all ""performance-type"" cars (like the 5.0l
Mustangs, Camaros, and the like) we'd cut down on the number of
accidents each year. Autos are fine for sedate little sedans,
but they have no business in performance cars, IMHO.

The 1960's generation were the most spoiled and irresponsible.

The Depression had create mothers and fathers that were determined that their
kids would not want for anything -- going overboard and creating a nation of
brats.

Consider the contrast between two famous events in July of 1969.

Apollo 11 and Woodstock.

Which group had large numbers of people that could not feed themselves and
reverted to the cultural level of primitives (defecation in public etc.).

And which group assembled, took care of itself, and dispersed with no damage,
no deaths, no large numbers of drug problems ....

58,"Hi... I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx
in advance)

I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There
is this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says:
""....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.""   

					Thanx in advance... Shaz....

[I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.
The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style
of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant
differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying
text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by
hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts
around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the
original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are
generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are
something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,
but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's
much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians
believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of
translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's
enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that
it has much practical effect.

Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot
topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it
(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details
that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there
being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in
all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the
title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been
referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get
referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been
editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes
everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into
single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor
objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible
has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making
editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions
that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from
a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine
one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all
inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition
that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.
(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few
translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize
inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there
are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best,
I'm afraid.)",15,hi    i m religious guy dont take kinda flame  thanx advance  want know many different versions bible  version bible read front page says       contains inaccurate data inconsistencies   thanx advance    shaz      i m sure quite mean many different versions  primary distinction versions see today style translation  it s pretty unusual see significant differences meaning  differences underlying text  that s printing  manuscripts copied hand  slight differences resulted  enough manuscripts around scholars pretty good job recreating original  uncertainties  fortunately  generally level minor differences wording  something like     places whole sentences involved  recent discoveries older manuscripts  don t think there s much uncertainly cases  far know  christians believe process copying manuscripts process translating free error  also don t think there s enough uncertainty establishing text translating much practical effect  whether bible contains inaccurate data inconsistences hot topic debate here  many christians deny it  accept  though would say inaccuracies involved details don t affect faith   nothing multiple versions  supposed inconsistences found versions  i m surprised find reference title page though  version talking about  i ve referring major scholarly translations  get referenced postings elsewhere  certainly editions  to kind  less widely accepted  includes everything reconstructions combine parallel accounts single narrations  editions omit material editor objects reason other  copyright bible long since expired  nothing stop people making editions whatever wierd thing want  however editions widely used carefully prepared groups scholars variety backgrounds  lots crosschecks  could imagine one lesser known editions claiming fixed inaccurate data inconsistencies  so  it s edition that s widely used  widely used ones leave text is   weeeeelllllll  almost is  it s alleged translations fudged word two minimize inconsistencies  translation exact science  always going differences opinion word best  i m afraid  ,religion

OK, you guys stirred up my childhood memories, so I went and did
some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season. It turns
out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate, at least as
far as the Phillies record goes. On September 1 1964 this was the
top of the N.L. standings:

                 W     L    GB
Philadelphia    79    51    -

Philadelphia    92    70    1
Cincinnati      92    70    1
San Francisco   90    72    3

Now it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short
were really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of
the day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which
time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the
Phillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at
that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one
of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of
the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched
a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It
would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the
year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.
Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1
through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than
the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that
stretch.

Yes, it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It
makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and
liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to
health for another go around.

It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with
free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic
competition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying
bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.

I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution
was supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries?  Seriously.

I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space
limit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk is
concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space.
The limit that causes the message, ""Windows will only use ...,"" is the
amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will
create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have
when Windows starts.

In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:

	PageOverCommit=multiplier

The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:

	This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of
	linear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is
	computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to
	the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value
	specified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the
	amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data
	structures to increase.  This also increases paging activity
	proportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a
	value between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry,
	you must edit SYSTEM.INI.

74,"I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system:

486-33 DX, 16 mb of ram
on a Novell 3.11 network
Monitor:  NEC 4FGe, capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate

Major considerations:

I expect I will work mostly in windows, but with some DOS
applications and I would want decent speed in DOS.  I do mostly word
processing, database and communications--not much intensive graphics.

With a 15"" monitor, I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256

and rock solid.

Other considerations:

I sometimes run a Unix clone (Coherent) and I understand that some
companies (e.g. Diamond?) don't encourage the third-party
development of drivers.

I might move to OS/2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability
than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking.

I don't have a local bus motherboard--I'm not sure how much to invest
in an ISA video board (versus getting something less expensive now and
upgrading to local bus later).

I like buying things from companies that treat their customers well.

odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer, that is driven
by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle.  These pulses are 
converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer.
No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage
reading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to
change as any other mechanical odometer.

On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor
and run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple
switch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter,
which will enable the car to reach it's full speed.  ;-)

The Toshiba has a 200ms access time, the NEC has a 280ms access
time, right around the Sony/Apple. Access time is, of course,
somewhat important, but not as vital in the case of CDs as data
transfer rate.

All the drives are double-speed drives with maximum data transfer
rates of 300K/second. Any is a good choice. Apple's is very cheap
when included with new Macs and I agree with Christian's comment
about drivers.

Plus, Apple's is bootable on the Centris and Quadra 800. A very nice
feature if you need to install System software. I don't know if the
NEC or Toshiba are bootable on those machines.",4,article   ps d innrc  srvr  engin umich edu   chyang leghorn engin umich edu  chung hsiung yang  writes     in article  bauer                             bauer informatik uni ulm de  christian bauer  writes     article  afi shs  vohmrylee andrew cmu edu    donpaul c  stephens      deathbird  cmu edu  wrote            difference       want double spin cd rom drive may           looking nec apple  doublespins      best        nec toshiba sony  apple  nearly deliver speed     apples prices low  compared ram simms     buy inexpencive  think driver revisions     easier get driver kits apple every    manufacturer       christian bauer       bauer informatik uni ulm de       thought nec toshiba cd rom mechanism average  access time less     ms  sony apple cd rom  drive access time     ms doublespin models       chung yang   toshiba    ms access time  nec    ms access time  right around sony apple  access time is  course  somewhat important  vital case cds data transfer rate  drives double speed drives maximum data transfer rates    k second  good choice  apple s cheap included new macs agree christian s comment drivers  plus  apple s bootable centris quadra      nice feature need install system software  don t know nec toshiba bootable machines ,classifieds

The economic and political ignorance of most Americans can be truly scary.
Price controls and government intervention.  The surest route to
disaster.  It's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or
common sense).  Price controls do not, and cannot work.  I would have
thought our last experiment in the 70's would have been enough to 
dampen the belief that price controls can actually work.  As for
government intervention, people never seem to get the irony of what
the are saying.  We are told that entitlements are the biggest portion
of the budget and they must be 'controlled'.  We are presented with
horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies.
We are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get
in our government run hospitals.  We are just now seeing stories about
how Social Security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that
should come as any surprise).  And yet, people choose to ignore all
of that and believe in the fairy tale of the government coming to
the rescue.  Simply amazing.

Some motherboards support VL bus and 50-DX CPU.  There is an option
(BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to
CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives
the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s)
are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to
enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.

This is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre-
tations.  Your mileage may vary.

Strictly speaking, VL and 50mhz are not compatable.  And, there is at
least one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work.

Wetteland comes off the DL on April 23rd, and will be evaluated on the 24th.
He is throwing well, and without pain on the side.

DeShields is not on the DL.  He suffered from the chicken pox and lost

     The Center for Disease Control will launch a worldwide network to track 
the spread of infectious diseases and detect drug-resistant or new strains in 
time to help prevent their spread.  The network is expected to cost between 
$75 million and $125 million but is  an essential part of the Clinton 
administration's health reform  plan, according to the CDC and outside 
experts.  The plan will  require the CDC to enhance surveillance of disease in 
the United  States and establish about 15 facilities across the world to  
track disease.

     The National Institutes of Health has announced it will start  treating 
HIV-positive patients as soon as possible after  seroconversion, resulting 
from recent findings that show HIV is  active in the body in large numbers 
much earlier than was  previously believed.  Anthony Fauci, director of the 
U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said, 
""We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly 
can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will 
get around microbial resistance.""  He said any delay would signify questions 
over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co-
authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the  
argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery 
indicates that ""$1 billion spent on vaccine trials"" has been ""a waste of time 
and money"" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were 
infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of 
Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument 
for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the 
new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand 
the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  ""We've known about this 
for five years, but we're  glad it is now in the public domain,"" said Jesse 
Dobson of the  California-based Project Inform.  But Peter Duesberg, who  
believes that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug  abuse in the 
West, said, ""We are several paradoxes away from an  explanation of AIDS--even 
if these papers are right.""

""Risk of AIDS Virus From Doctors Found to Be Minimal"" Washington Post 
(04/14/93), P. A9 

     The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health-care  
professionals to patients is minimal, according to new research  published in 
today's Journal of the American Medical Association  (JAMA).  This finding 
supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of 
contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the 
JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive 
surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies 
were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and 
Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and 
tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found 
that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an  
HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.  In Maryland, 413 of 1,131 
patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital 
were found to be HIV-negative.  Similarly  in Florida, 900 of 1,192 dental

patients, who all had been  treated by an HIV-positive general dentist, were 
tested and found to be negative for HIV.  The Florida researchers, led by 
Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said, 
""This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general 
dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal 
precautions are strictly observed.""   Related Story: Philadelphia Inquirer

""Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program"" AIDS 
Treatment News (04/02/93) No. 172, P. 6  (Gilden, Dave) 

     The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of 
Health has raised questions about the NIH's commitment to an  effort that uses 
unorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  The OAM is a small division of 
the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 
billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available 
research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be 
available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for 
Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid 
to become involved in AIDS.  ""They have to look successful and there is no 
easy answer in AIDS,"" she said.    There is also a common perception that the 
OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, 
such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an 
advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS 
community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' 
general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic 
will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, ""The OAM advisory 
panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  
will take them several years to accept the nature of research.""   
Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator 
at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, ""Here is a 
wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the 
Office time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much 
more [than  public relations].""

""Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers"" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, 
No. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) 

     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-
6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack 
causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in 
the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a 
factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  
found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, 
which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can

kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural 
killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  
research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural 
killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony 
L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube 
findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the 
body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  
molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface 
receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that 
herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.

     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only 
ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health 
problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert 
and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, 
Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  
respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care 
about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for 
the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should 
be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it 
is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  
respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic 
development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  
Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have 
on many developing countries, and the increased need for international 
assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political 
aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there 
is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach 
to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in 
particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book ""Earth in the 
Balance"" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable 
international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child 
survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the 
developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  
change the future of worldwide health.

     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible 
before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less 
attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller 
Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and 
Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as 
malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  
economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention 
than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is 
receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most 
developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic 
diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another 
year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS 
and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden 
but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a 
rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each 
individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley 
says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  
economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he 
concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the 
United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries 
with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  
has been the rule.

            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children

        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children


The National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental 
HIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. 

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 
children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-
infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. 

HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as ""a 
hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected 
children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS."" 

Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial ""is 
the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay 
disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.""  If these 
vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their 
therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in 
the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health 
Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. 

The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which 
funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial 
at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the 
ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development. 

Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows 
that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and

stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers 
know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. 

The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined 
closely for other reasons as well.  ""This trial will provide the first insight 
into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,"" said 
Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  ""We need this 
information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent 
HIV infection in children."" 

In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city 
areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. 

Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during 
pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than 
a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing 
numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection 
drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding 
increase in the numbers of infected children. 

HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  
The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV 
develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These 
infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of 
childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms 
leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. 

At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger 
to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older 
participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no 
symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen 
liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-
regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. 

Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical 
School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of 
Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical 
officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. 

""We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children 
for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or 
fevers, for example, than another,"" said Dr. McNamara.  ""We'll also look at 
whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other 
significant laboratory or clinical effects.""   He emphasized that the small 
study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three

products. 

The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from 
recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically 
engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-
tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. 

One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a 
protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  
Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is 
the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 

Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco 
and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in 
Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus 
adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine 
contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in 
other Phase I vaccine trials in adults. 

A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 
children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the 
experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, 
considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will 
be told what they receive. 

If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the 
experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will 
begin. 

Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six 
months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

           NEW EVIDENCE THAT THE HIV CAN CAUSE DISEASE INDEPENDENTLY
              News from the National Institute of Dental Research

There is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease 
independently of its ability to suppress the immune system, say scientists at 
the National Institues of Health. 

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling 
skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the 
HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' 
immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV 
itself caused the skin disease. 

Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease 
without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the 
National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues 
described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human 
Retroviruses. 

Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most 
animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this 
problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for 
HIV as well as their own genetic material. 

NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse 
eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters 
contained both normal and transgenic animals. 

Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV 
genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon 
after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an 
incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. 

Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their 
necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin 
lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No 
skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. 

Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a 
type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can 
cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the 
animals. 

Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the 
presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50
Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were ""turned 
on,"" or active, said Dr. Kopp. 

The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the 
mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common 
infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune 
systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the 
skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. 

Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists 
exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV 
genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  
Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the 
genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No 
lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. 

The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter 
Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases. 

Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. 
Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; 
Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, 
formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide 
clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care 
professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV 
infection or AIDS. 
     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a 
physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on 
drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is 
funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of 
San Francisco General Hospital. 
     Secretary Shalala said, ""One goal of this project is to share expertise 
so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health 
care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces 
treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and 
community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients 
with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience."" 
     Secretary Shalala said, ""This clinical expertise should be especially 
helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in 
communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available."" 
     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and 
it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) 
Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer 
questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and 
health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be 
answered as quickly as possible. 
     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question 
related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment 
information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, 
literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health 
care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate 
sources of information or materials. 
     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken 
by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse 
practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and 
inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant 
asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current 
medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history. 
     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that

Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern 
California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health 
Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and 
by the American Academy of Family Physicians. 
     ""When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of 
care they are able to provide to their patients,"" said HRSA Administrator 
Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  ""This project will be a great resource for 
health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve."" 
     ""This service has opened a new means of communication between health care 
professionals and experts on HIV care management,"" said HRSA's associate 
administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources 
Development, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  ""Providers who treat people with 
HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment 
methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS."" 
     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.

	In Islam, there is no compulsion, just a tax on dhimini.  In
Judaism, non-Jews are allowed to do as they wish, and there is no
effort made to convert them.

Agreed here...I'll never forget Dan Kelly calling the play-by-play in the '87
Canada Cup.  He was masterful!

And Danny Gallivan will _never_ be replaced; even now when I watch HNIC I
remember his voice...when I see an Al MacInnis or Al Iafrate (hey, what's with
these guys named Al who can shoot??) shot from the point I still think
""blistering blast""...THN had a tribute to Gallivan in the issue following his
death; in the story they included a quote from one of the games he did.  It
went: 

""It appears Risebrough has pugnaciously construed that check,"" he said, ""and 
will undoubtedly make a visitation to the box of punition.""

The DC-X will not take of horizontally.  It takes of vertically.

For several reasons.  Vertical landings don't require miles of runway and limit
noise pollution.  They don't require wheels or wings.  Just turn on the engines
and touch down.  Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren't quite
that simple.

Well, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you're learning.

The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets
just before they hit the ground.  Parachutes are, however, not especially
practical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  The landings
are also not very comfortable.  However, in the words of Georgy Grechko,

Hi Adda,

Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain
time -- the time when the author wrote it.  Unfortunately, like all works
from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.

There are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the
mid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books, letters,
etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of
the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout
this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who
quoted various scriptures in their writings.

> 2.  Is there any truth in my acquaintance's statements?

If you mean that someone discovered thousands of ""Bibles"" which were all
perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!

If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the
dates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable
text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest
original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime
shortly after A.D. 50, then yes.

From the original authors.  We call them Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter,
Paul, James, and one other not identified.

Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode
(probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not
spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the
spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be
available, or you need to retrain a new team.

Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.
Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA 
series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.
Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a ""standby"" mode for
use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still
required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is
relatively cheap.

Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance
to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-
stabilized control mode because it would require little power or 
maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time
to time.

In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),
but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.",14,article    apr             kelvin jpl nasa gov   baalke kelvin jpl nasa gov  ron baalke  writes     in article      apr                 zeus calpoly edu   jgreen trumpet calpoly edu  james thomas green  writes      why spacecraft shut funding cuts    example  couldn t magellan told go  safe    mode stay bobbing venus low power use mode   maybe years funding gets restored economy   gets better  hopefully   could turned again     it be  problem political one  technical one  also remember every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft safe mode  probably spin stabilized sun pointing orientation  dollar spent mission analysis newer spacecraft  order turn spacecraft back on  either need insure ops guys available  need retrain new team  said that  spacecraft proposed  many operational satellites goddard flies  like tiros noaa series  require one satellite orbit operational set  extras get replaced on orbit powered  standby  mode use emergency  case  however  ops team still required fly operational birds  standby maintenance relatively cheap  finally  pat s explanation  some spacecraft require continuous maintenance stay control  also right mark  suggested spin  stabilized control mode would require little power maintenance  still might require momentum dumping time time  end   is  political decision  since difference money   technical rationale behind decision ,vehicles

                An Appeal to Mankind

During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,
documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.

The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace.

The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.

Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.
Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also
been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.
Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives 
of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central
Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.

One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific
experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection 
of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.

We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,
for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are
violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,
its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of
Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over 
the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the
USSR and the United States. 

One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent 
events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on
Azerbaijan.

It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the
issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their
representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan
SSR.

We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we 
are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one
of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic 
Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.

But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists
encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000
Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the 
neighboring lands.

The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,
suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.

But what about the lives of seven million human beings?
If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are
less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their 
colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other
attributes?

All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal
of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous
appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus
in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the
Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved
by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict
lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which
were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of
thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. 

Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred
thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and
Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims
at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole
thing has now gone entirely too far.

They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 
78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this 
time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the 
plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. 

Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992

                    MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED

     Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today 
of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.
     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed
1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and 
massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered
mountain passes.
     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani
reports of a massacre.

                         Scalping Reported
     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region
by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their
heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them 
from retrieving more bodies.
     ""Women and children have been scalped,"" said Assad Faradshev, an aide
to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. ""When we began to pick up bodies,
they began firing at us.""
     The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: ""The bodies
are lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this.""
                         
                         Truckloads of Bodies
     Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer,
Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani
bodies.
     ""In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were as
many in the second,"" she said. ""Some had their head cut off, and many had
been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus
himself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than
heaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new
churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev,
chapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word
""throne"" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the
assignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are
already judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no
recourse, excuse or defense.

Yes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to
extremes before stopping at ""moderation.""  I think we have seen the extreme of
the ""hell fire & brimstone"" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme
where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones
sensibilities.

I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a
story.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the
point of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed
everybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to
pray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man
wouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in
hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't
exist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't
exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And
yet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.

I'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. 
When I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that
isn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call. 
It's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the

I think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all,
repentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from!
No, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we
should do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  

I have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I
would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its
eternality.

1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness.
2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.
   If responsible, then he is also accountable.
3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God.
4) Christ.  He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to

KS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome
KS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg
KS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information

I'm not sure that this condition is ""recognised"" anywhere (in the
sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries
between it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic
features, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.

Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease
by clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities
are mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of
ongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of
declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.
Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless
contributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows
muscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old
denervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit
action potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation
(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation
with reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active
denervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme
staining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.

Post-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically
evident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,
the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one
year to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio
before who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among
polio survivors than among people who never had polio.

The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little
evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or
destructive immunologic response to virus antigen.

There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have
anything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,
motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than
patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.
Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason
for these ""acute"" changes in a ""chronic"" disease (old polio) is
unknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge
numbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several
years.

There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio
syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny
deterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe
polio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.
They also tend to score higher on depression scales of
neuropsychologic tests.

My take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from
severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,
ligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or
degenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing
pain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads
to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am
perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS
patient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe
that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than
non-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but
without PPS complaints).",13,ks  from  keith actrix gen nz  keith stewart  ks my wife become interested acquaintance post polio syndrome ks this apparently recognised new zealand different symptons   eg ks chest complaints  treated separately  anone information i m sure condition  recognised  anywhere  in sense disease diagnostic criteria  clear boundaries diseases  unique pathologic physiologic features  etc   goes many neurologists agree on  post polio syndrome patients evidence motor neuron disease clinical examination  emg  muscle biopsy  abnormalities mostly chronic  due old polio  evidence ongoing deterioration  clinically  patients complain declining strength endurance everyday motor tasks  musculoskeletal pain nearly universal feature doubtless contributes impaired performance  examination shows muscle weakness atrophy  emg shows evidence old denervation reinnervation  giant long duration motor unit action potentials   and  evidence active denervation  fibrillation potentials   biopsy also shows old denervation reinnervation  fiber type grouping   and  evidence active denervation  small  angulated fibers dense oxidative enzyme staining    curiously  little group atrophy  post polio patients als  als  clinically evident deterioration one month next  post polio  patients remarkably stable objective findings one year next  course  patients polio develop genuine als  als common among polio survivors among people never polio  cause post polio syndrome unknown  little evidence post polio patients active polio virus destructive immunologic response virus antigen  solid evidence patients post polio anything different happening motor unit  anterior horn cells  motor axons  neuromuscular junctions  muscle fibers  patients old polio complaining deterioration  groups emg biopsy findings  reason  acute  changes  chronic  disease  old polio  unknown  possibly spinal motor neurons  that reinnervated huge numbers muscle fibers  start shedding load several years  couple clinical features distinguish post polio syndrome patients patients old polio deny deterioration  pps patients likely severe polio  pps patients  much  likely complain pain  also tend score higher depression scales neuropsychologic tests  take  i m sure disagree   recovery severe polio abnormal loading muscles  tendons  ligaments  bones  joints  leads inflammatory and or degenerative conditions affecting structures  increasing pain  superimposed chronic  but unchanging  weakness  leads progressive impairment motor performance adl  perhaps biased personal experience never seen pps patient limited way pain  believe pps patients rapid deterioration motor units non pps patients  i e   old polio similar severity without pps complaints  ,politics

You can't make GL calls in an XmDrawingArea widget for sure.  
: 
: There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or
: GlxDraw (athena) widget.  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea, except that it
: allows you to use GL calls to render into the window.  Look at glxlink,
: glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.
: 
: 
: The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.

I can vouch for that. The GL Widget works pretty well. I have been using it
for sometime now. I'm not sure though whether you can use Xlib calls to draw
into the GL widget. I haven't tried it yet nor have I read the accompanying
documentation completely. Try posting to comp.sys.sgi for more information.
Better still,you will find most of the answers in the  SGI manuals .. there
is a little transition guide which explains the ""mixed-model programming""
paradigm(Mixing X and GL).

Well, PEX is designed as an extension to  X and will be more seamless  but 
then, it is buggy to start with .. opinions again.

: I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged

: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and
: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective
: qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.

The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*
married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.

e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall
leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh''
(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).

If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the
phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This
implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the
point of intercourse.

Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary
was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were
*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which
required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary
and Joseph went to bed together.

Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is
described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes 
place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with
Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will
take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,
because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.

In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is
not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the
point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the
civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.)
Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a
marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since
Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be
corrected on that point!)

This view obviously raises some questions:

What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering
marriage. Are those people also ``married''?

If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary
to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours
the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep
together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-
honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before
actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and
also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive
to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)

Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I
believe you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this?
Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which

Yours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you

I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind.
What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.

>Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself.

Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain 
knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the
Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and
there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond
our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  
to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a
person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find 
something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one
will gain with that attitude is folly.

Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages
in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even
though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.
Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such
deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. 
I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, ""You will never
be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.""


From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):

    ""It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;
     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.""


Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:

   ""No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.""


And in John 3:16:

   ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal
   life.""


You are included in ""whosoever"".  And I also pray that the Father is
drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting
to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the
making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure
stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became
on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.

You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because
you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack
Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,
proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.

Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would 
probably say to you: ""Satan would surely like to have you.""  Why so?
Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great
moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task
he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the
faith to walk on water as Jesus did.

You asked ""Why not believe in Zeus?""  Zeus didn't offer eternal life.

Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame.  If society
accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when
an innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should
work to convince others.

And, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered
the risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must accept
the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely
going to happen when so many people are driving.  It is all a question of

I agree entirely.  Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's
worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of
Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically
that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis
of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,
morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the
three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of
sex, race or sexual orientation.

I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend
everyone to read them.

There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:

1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever)
2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation
(though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who
indulge
3) As 2, but ""love the sinner""
4) Accept homosexuality altogether.

My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2
are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).

I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that
a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on
discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex,
would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the
pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the

Yes I fully agree with that, but is it ""I don't believe gods exist"", or
""I believe no gods exist""? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka)
pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word ""believe"" to mean.

Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak
atheism, at least according to the FAQ:

# Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.
# Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is
# often referred to as the ""weak atheist"" position, and the latter as ""strong
# atheism"".
# 
# It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  ""Weak
# atheism"" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  ""Strong
# atheism"" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not
# fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are ""strong atheists"".

Unfortunately, you're wrong on both counts.  The most common method of
implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator.  The
local oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via
the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great
care.

For a reference on detecting radios, get the paperback book _Spy Catcher_.
The author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local
oscillator emissions back in the *1950s* while he worked for British
Intelligence.

Take your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when I
was a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable
is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.
 
Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows
the power of religion and not anything about its claims.

It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil
happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil,
is another evil.

The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even
before the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known,
the course of events is fixed.
 
Not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.

And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said
something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have
what you define as free will.
 
Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them.
Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good
deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence
of good as evil.
 
But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it.
Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you
have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent
reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye
biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe
chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian
genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian,
she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong
characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian
ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian
from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant
Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen
Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from
Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married
David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married
William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of
Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their
daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the
eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady
Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also
referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic
Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish
gene mix is dynamite.

You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed.
Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,
massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly 
people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated 
the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 
1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today 
in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide 
that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought 
they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the 
Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian 
terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle 
resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent
Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that 
they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia 
today.


Source: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian
armies in 1914, ""History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume
II: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975).""
(London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316.

""In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city 
 of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, 
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan 
 on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized 
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during 
 the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the
 southern side of the lake.""

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves.""

""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
 World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.""

   As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well. We changed
side 1967-09-03 (or 03-SEP-1967). I don't remeber the exactly time but
it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg
all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole
weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before.

Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and
after it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was
prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to
reveal the new right mode arrow.

The year after Iceland also changed.

About cars: Before the H-day (H as in ""Hoegertrafik"". ""hoeger"" is
Swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their
steering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had
the wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on
the right side. :-)

More contries that uses the left side is:

Japan
Tanzania (I think)
New Zeeland
How about South Africa?

BTW. Some sais that the left side is the right side because Ivanhoe
and other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments. :-)

Fishing rights are disputed.  Between 2 nations, no matter *how* 
friendly, there is ALWAYS fishing disputes.

What I was getting at was the 54 40' or fight slogan is OLD STUFF
dealing with the LAND dispute.  No one is saying 54 40' or fight 
about fishing rights.  The territorial dispute about the Oregon
Territory (we called it) is LONG resolved.

Try this:  flip your mouse over, and open up the cover that holds the
mouse ball in place.  Remove the ball, and inside you should see
(probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of
caked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully
scrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful*
You do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.
Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.  

I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom
is that when you move the mouse, it seems to ""click"" along.  If this
doesn't solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.  I highly
recommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak,
place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep
the dust off.

Personally I prefer track balls.  Oh, which brings me to another point:
if your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is 
streaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice
that it will stop working.  If this happens to you, close the curtains
or blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps.

Why do you think Steere is doing this?  Isn't he acting in good faith?
After all, as the ""discoverer"" of Lyme for all intents and purposes,
the more famous Lyme gets, the more famous Steere gets.  I don't
see the ulterior motive here.  It is easy for me to see it the
those physicians who call everything lyme and treat everything.
There is a lot of money involved.

Well, it is tragic what has happened to you, but it doesn't
necessarily make you the most objective source of information
about it.  If your whole life is focussed around this, you
may be too emotionally involved to be advising other people
who may or may not have Lyme.  Certainly advocacy of more research
on Lyme would not be out of order, though, and people like you
can be very effective there.

Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the
last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though
I haven't seen any Glock's). 

With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual
rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two
cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a 
large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to
semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand
him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is
very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something 
like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that
""different is good"".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in 
more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a
certain ""propriatory nature"" of each gun that takes some familiarity to 
learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar
with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least
slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.

Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either
pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi
auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.

I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA
semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same
round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will
always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud
but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will
now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide
on a misfire takes very little time.

Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not
necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and
at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the
round to set it off.

The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed
loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two
handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that
while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the
gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always 
take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing
a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can
still be used if needed later).

Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear
it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire
with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto
but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).

All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any
safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should
say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's
no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing
pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage
carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed
of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm
not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was
initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining
the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and 
shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in
a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets
you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.

Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver
for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all
your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger
far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that
nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and
relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew
off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.

I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry
weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to
r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the
shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the
fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is
a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.

9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still
lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the
street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry

i agree -- if you are going to find out anything from people who don't
share your beliefs, do not attack them or condescend to them and hope
to get a neutral picture of them.  come to them with an open mind.

well, you do believe in something, as i see it, even if it is a sort
of ""anti-belief"" (no negative connotation meant; i mean simply that
you believe that God _does not_ exist).  christians can also feel that
sense of ""difference"", however, when they are associated with ""those
weird televangelists who always talk about satan"".  if you'll excuse
the cliched sound of this, everyone has to deal with his/ her
differences from other people.  i can understand how being an atheist
could be hard for you; being a christian is sometimes hard for me.

you should not have to repress how you feel -- you should be able to
discuss it without fear.  i think there are admirable things to learn
from any belief, which can enrich your own -- by asking myself the
questions that atheists may ask me, i can learn the answers and become
stronger in my faith.  if my faith can't support knowing the answers
to those questions, it is weak and untrue.

in some way the pressures were different, of course, because you
""chose"" your beliefs -- or are you saying that they were not your
choice, but born of necessity?  [please, no flames about whether or
not gay people ""choose"" their lifestyle -- that's elsewhere in this

ouch, yes.  part of being a christian is accepting _everyone_ with an
open heart -- including people of ""our own camp"" with whom we
completely disagree.  by the same token, i believe that accusation and
suspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith,
nor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting our
religion.  i have a different idea of mission: be what i am, a
christian who is happy in her faith, and if others see that and want
to know about either the happiness or the religion, i'll share what i
know without pressure and let them make their own decisions.  at some
point you just have to agree to disagree -- acceptance of diversity,
not uniformity, is the way to sow peace....

I think 
1) outlaw the use of these substances without warning labels as
large as those on cig. packages.
2) Require 30% of comparable products on the market to be free of these
substances and state that they are free of MSG, DYES, NITROSIAMINES and SULFITES on the package.
3) While at it outlaw yellow dye #5.  For that matter why dye food?  
4) Take the dyes and flavorings out of vitamins.  (In my OSCO only Stress

The Cold War has not ended.  The only thing that has happened is that 
the two sides have exchanged roles.

The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population)
than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California,
it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in
California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of
these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police
now confiscate property, without trial, under a ""good faith probable
cause"" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug
dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a
majority will answer ""yes"" if you ask them whether civil liberties and
due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The
Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't
know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but
I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.

According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over
TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the
marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own
business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves
than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under
the ""War on Drugs"" campaign of ""zero tolerance"" due process protections
have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have
proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians
who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only
legal, but political:  ""My fellow Americans, we must send our young
people the message that we are serious about winning the War On
Murder""--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun
prohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine
they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different
tastes in recreational drugs.

What goes around comes around.

Science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising.  One
aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses
resulting from the models produced by this thinking process.

Science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world.
It is objective.

Anything which affects the physical world can be studied.  For example,
since we are part of the physical world, anything (including spirits) which
affects our behaviour can be observed.  Science does not make any claims
about the existence or non-existence of objects which do not affect the
physical world.

The purpose of science is to produce a model of the *physical* world.  The
model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome
of future observations.  One of the aims of experiments is to carry out
well defined observations which are objective.

Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world, and
the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions.  At the
moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world
existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a
*spiritual* world.  As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions it
should be the currently accepted models.

The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the
correct ones, whereas many religions claim to represent the truth.  The

Fire an Anschutz .22, then come back and talk to us.  You're letting

Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry.
Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for
some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To
extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence
to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a
weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training
time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years
practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one
(though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would
have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of
training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.

Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's
make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been
taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted
murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.

In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered
your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and
shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few
world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons
tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though,
were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or
were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just
registering the shotgun?

I'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only
a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most
feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to
spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing.
Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become
civilized with?

>	Yes, I know a little American history, but is it a civil/human

Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not
a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as ""Americans"" first
and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage,
whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in
your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale
and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a
basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.
In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal
liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but
I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict
individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd
hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and
personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would
have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture
we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy
to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother
tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke
""low Dane,"" whereas others spoke ""high Dane.""  It was shortly after
World War II, as I remember, that ""low Dane"" was abolished so there was
one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem,
because we have even more obvious means of identifying an ""outsider.""

WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC

1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE ""SPINOFFS"" WE WERE PROMISED?
In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published ""The
Man Who Sold the Moon,"" which involved a dispute over the sale of
rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this
 hideous vision of the future.  Observers were
startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the
pad with ""SCHWARZENEGGER"" painted in huge block letters on the
side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged
for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing
is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on
a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth
orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,
since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This
may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of
Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone
monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs.

What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize

No difference there between T1 and TT!   

And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty
rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters
is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy
price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there
is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')

Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is
a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.

The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example,
you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a
font may very well have them.

ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a
new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow
you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the
`fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities
that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?

Well, let me put it this way, based on my own experience.  A
general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases,
by establishing links to the ""Lyme community"", treating patients
who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they
have lyme as if they did, saying that diseases such as MS
are probably spirochetal, if not Lyme, giving talks at meetings
of users groups, validating the feelings of even delusional
patients, etc.  This GP can go from being a run-of-the-mill
$100K/yr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital
and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his
office, and making lots of bread.  Also getting the adulation
of many who believe his is their only hope (if not of cure,
then of control) and seeing his name in publications put out
by support groups, etc.  This is a definite temptation.

Realizing the taterific importance of this work, John Palmer and I
concluded that we might be able to pool some resources. I have not yet
gone through the archives that Jonathan sent to me; when I do, I will
send out an ""official"" introduction to the Deep Drive Derby.

However, I wonder if we need to rename the project, now that the
principal investigator and research archive have changed. Send your

For me, it would be an obvious choice: Armed self-defence is clearly
and strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws
of the state. In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical,
I wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless I had been
publicly carrying the weapon concealed, something I'm not in
the habit of doing... Even then, the worst I'd have to deal with 
was a class 2 misdemeanor.) Even if the situation were not so
clear, and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or
homicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. If
I were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, I'd be committing
several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence
in court (""If it really was self-defence,"" the prosecuter would
ask, ""why did you run away and hide from the police?"")

In other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut:
If someone in, say, Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defence
he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of
that city's gun control laws. Such a person's choices would be
between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible
conviction for half a dozen.

>I think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun,
>but HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THAT?  You still haven't offered

I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even
contributed a few comments) but this stuff ""I'd rather face a knife than
a gun"" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the
same thing, then I got 'educated.'

People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how
quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that
it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick
(within a minute or so) death.

The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage
points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are
'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly
only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a
remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a
spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.

Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by
accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for
a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only
moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a
DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out
of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and
ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and
strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks
used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled
slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained
martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up
against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as
the attacker.

Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing
with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a
knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their
knife attacks in prison.

If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize
these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is
the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced
attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old
man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about
one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking
cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike
in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3
seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons
that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest
with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the
pointed end.)

Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.
Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that
destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve
seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'

This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman
in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That
lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All
four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta
girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex
of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and
destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball
sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was
out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight
months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was
on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think
civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.

The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife
attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good
alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk
(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor
them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact
weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and
is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a
caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually
do this.

Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live
and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason
'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep
us alive.

I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now
know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would
have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I
WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not

199,"Hi everyone. I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for my
new LCIII, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may
be a 512K LC vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. So
I'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so I can figure
out what type of chip MacConnection sent me.

Each chip says: M518121A-80J
		 2515251

On the back of the card, it says 0593

I believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but I can't figure
out what the size is supposed to be. If anyone can help, I'd be grateful.
Please email me your response. Thanks a lot!

207,"The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum
Sunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0
shutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke
a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from
mounting any serious attack.

Injuries:

Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.

Roster Moves:

Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS
second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years
old, 6'4"", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,
12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in
this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him
up front as well.

Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period
of the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,
and played again for Hershey Sunday night.

Lines:

Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi
Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen
Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy
Acton-Brown

Galley-McGill
Yushkevich-Cronin
Carkner-Hawgood
Bowen

Tommy Soderstrom in goal.

Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.

Game Summary:

If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this
year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after
scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.

Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.
He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead
of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.
A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a
goal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.

Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when
he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing
unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The
Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept
away every rebound.

After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour
gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the
net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef
Beranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to
get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into
the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for
a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.

The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS
from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and
defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies
were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.
Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had
a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into
him, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno
was a little far from the boards, and Mike ""Mister"" McGeough felt that it
warranted a boarding call at 15:38

The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were
very aggressive (for a change) on the kill.

With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone
and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in
a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass
to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark
checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and
went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside
the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own
goalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.

The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk
tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the
FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric
gloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We
could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove
and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was
running out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal
mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where
Recchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,
and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past
Bobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at
117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.

Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on
the power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with
a slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most
of the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers
flared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton
got a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a
hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's
stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.
Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.
Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski
tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,
and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as
nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,
but Soderstrom stoned him.

The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't
get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.

The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they
decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a
little.

The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the
period, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making
road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros 
(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)
all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.

Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.

At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left
circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and
as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards
it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the
other). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the
Leafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom
stoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through
Soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept
away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was
equal and preserved the shutout.

Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl
at 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski
Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek
expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to
set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS
zone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran
his stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.
5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.
Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got
a couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!
Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski
and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.

So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest
in stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until
Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and
blasted it past Puppa at 18:39.

That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa
did, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the
3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star
break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in
the NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't
remember that he's tied with.

Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot
be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night
in Washington would be the official end.

FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points
in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6
games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better
than 5 under in 80).

Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th
is 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to
lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS
will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie
breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble
down the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and
finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the
goal for the team to focus on.

Piper lived in my town (Williamsport, PA) when he killed himself.  It
was in the early '60's.  He had had more than a few books published by
that time, but he was down on his luck financially.  Rumor was that he
was hunting urban pigeons with birdshot for food.  He viewed himself as
a resourceful man, and (IMO) decided to check out gracefully if he
couldn't support himself.  The worst part is that John Campbell, the
long-time editor of Astounding/Analog SF magazine had cut a check for
Piper's most recent story, and said check was in the mail.  If Campbell
had known Piper's straits, I'm sure he would have phoned to say hang on.
Campbell was like that.

Sure.  Contact the World Space Foundation.  They're listed in the sci.space
Frequently Asked Questions file, which I'll excerpt.

    WORLD SPACE FOUNDATION - has been designing and building a solar-sail
    spacecraft for longer than any similar group; many JPL employees lend
    their talents to this project. WSF also provides partial funding for the
    Palomar Sky Survey, an extremely successful search for near-Earth
    asteroids. Publishes *Foundation News* and *Foundation Astronautics
    Notebook*, each a quarterly 4-8 page newsletter. Contributing Associate,
    minimum of $15/year (but more money always welcome to support projects).

	World Space Foundation
	Post Office Box Y
	South Pasadena, California 91301

WSF put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and
nonfiction about solar sails: *Project Solar Sail*.  I think Robert
Staehle, David Brin,  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor.

Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman,
a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, Josh),
and I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something
to say about the subject in *The Starflight Handbook*, as well as
quite a few references.


Check the following articles in *Journal of the British Interplanetary
Society*:

V36 p. 201-209 (1983)
V36 p. 483-489 (1983)
V37 p. 135-141 (1984)
V37 p. 491-494 (1984)
V38 p. 113-119 (1984)
V38 p. 133-136 (1984)

(Can you guess that Matloff visited Fermilab and gave me a bunch of
reprints? I just found the file.)

What in the Tree makes you think we queers CAN'T experience that commitment? 
What's stopping us from committing to one partner for the rest of our lives? 
I have every intention of doing so, once I find the right person...and
whether that person is male or female, I seriously doubt that a church
ceremony/public vow/licence will make any difference whatsoever in the sort
of commitment I experience with that person.  You have no conception of the
difference marriage makes since you have never known any other way.

Hello.  Firstly, what do you exactly mean by ""fundamentalist""?  I will
for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes
that the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened
to him is what he'll call being ""born again""?  Anyway, was that recent?
If the answer is ""yes"" to all the questions above, it is quite
understandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend!
I think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can
say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to
communicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things
is because they are now ""obvious"" to him.  What is ""obvious"" to him is
not obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because
from his point of view, he has been on ""both sides of the fence"".  This
I mean that before he turned ""fundamentalist"", you two are agreeable
because both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if
a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the
discovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's
got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than
where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.
You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to
you, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that
risk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand
and listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because
he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,
however, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.

So far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,
I do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good
part of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or
""fundamentalists"" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their
faith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,
""religious belief"" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism
is also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is
inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),
it will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both
sides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can
do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's
trying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern
""for now"".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality -
and that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to
insult where you stand too.

Like I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.
I'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a
Christian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little
differently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited
and just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good
not to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of
the time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too -
but God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in
mind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real
to him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.

I don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow -
this is quite a challenge for you to face.  By the way, personal

Actually, the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as 
God commanded him to.  Lucifer was devoted to God.

Oh yeah, there is nothing in Genesis that says the snake was anything
more than a snake (well, a talking one...had legs at the time, too).

I don't think pointing out contradictions in STORIES is the best way
to show the error in theology:  if they think a supernatural entity
kicked the first humans out of paradise because they bit into a
fruit that gave them special powers...well, they might not respond
well to reason and logic.  :^)",0,article      apr             batman bmd trw com   jbrown batman bmd trw com writes     article  c twso  m  hq ileaf com   mukesh hq ileaf com  mukesh prasad  writes       article      apr             batman bmd trw com  jbrown batman bmd trw com writes        article   p v ainn e  matt ksu ksu edu   strat matt ksu ksu edu  steve davis  writes          bskendig netcom com  brian kendig  writes                    earth evil satan rules it                  new one me  guess it s since witness         bothered me  implying satan omniscient          might try tricking saying satan  all knowing          use statement show beliefs         self contradictary              no  satan omniscient  hold dominion earth       according christian theology  note  confused jw s       theology                   standard theologies who what created satan       why             orthodox christian theology states god created lucifer  satan     along angels  presumably wanted beings    celebrate  glorify  existence life  and thereby  god  along    him  actually whys wherefores god s motivations    creating angels big issue within christian theology        god created lucifer perfect nature gave along    angels free moral will  lucifer high angel  perhaps    highest  great authority  seems greatness caused    begin take pride desire equal    greater god  forgot place created being  exalted    god  thereby evil sin entered creation  actually  story goes lucifer refused bow man god commanded to  lucifer devoted god  oh yeah  nothing genesis says snake anything snake  well  talking one   had legs time  too   don t think pointing contradictions stories best way show error theology  think supernatural entity kicked first humans paradise bit fruit gave special powers   well  might respond well reason logic     ,religion

Unfortunately, things have been boding ill (is that a legitimate conjugation?)
for a while.  While the Office of Exploration had some great ideas, they never
got much money.  I've heard good things about Griffin, but it's hard to want
him back in a job where he couldn't do anything.

The group examining the Freedom-based space station redesign proposals is 
headed by Michael Griffin, ""NASA's cheif engineer"" in the words of Space News.
I believe this is him.

       As perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing works, the
local college newspaper had a big crusade to have the U.T. police
release crime stats.  (The school claimed that to do so would violate
federal education records privacy laws).  They swore up and down they
weren't interested in student discipline records, only for stats so people
could make an evaluation of how safe the campus was.

       It was barely a week after crime stats were released before the
Daily Beacon had an editorial calling for student disciplinary stats
to be released, because they complained certain segments of the campus
population were treated administratively rather than turned over to the
police and therefore the criminal states weren't accurate.

       What people say they want public today may not be what they
say tomorrow.

228,"This is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction.  If there
are no new bids then the current bids stand (like that's gonna  happen.  :) ).
After this, any updates will be by E-mail *ONLY*.  The entire auction 
will end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  So if you want to get in
on  this, be sure to bid now.  All bids must be made in *AT LEAST*
25 cent increments.  Buyer will pay shipping.  (Unless you have any
particular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of
padding).  
All dragons are bagged.  The condition of them vary quite a bit, 
so I've come up with my own condition system.  Some dragons may be missing 
items like the inserts.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
*
Condition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as
most of the material inside is in great shape.
Excellent - IE-""As you find them in the store""
Very Good - Still in great condition, but can tell it's been boughten
Good      - On down the line
Very Fair/fair - indicates lots of use (But still ""decent"")
Poor      -  Indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by
scissors).  
A * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is 
missing (usually the insert)
I'll post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the
final public posting, after which the auction will be by e-mail until
the bidding stops)
*
Again if you have any questions, ask away.

I don't meant to defend Eric Molas- I find it somewhat annoying when
someone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually
atheistic) beliefs, so I can certainly see how Christians might be
annoyed- but I'd like to point out a few things.

>I am glad that I am not an atheist.  It seems tragic that some people 
>choose a meaningless existence.

""no meaning from God"" is not the same as ""no meaning"". From my (atheistic)
point of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and
get some or make some.

No free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any
God can just ""give"" your life meaning, actually. If he
says you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose
if you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But
I digress...) 

>  How terrible to go on living only 
>because one fears death more than life.

This would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric
endures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like
it, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should
endeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say.
Terrible.

Probably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as
an illusion, and does not want it. So maybe it isn't so bad?

>As a Christian I am free to be a human person.  I think, love, choose, 
>and create.

As an atheist, I am free to be a human person. I think, love, choose,
and create.

> I will live forever with God.

Ah, now here we begin to diverge. I will not live forever
with anyone.

(I don't think you will either, but you are welcome to your
opinion on the matter.)

>Christ is not a kind of drug.

I tend to agree with you.

It's my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal
parts of human societies.

I think they have outlived their usefullness, but they
are evidently quite ordinary, normal things that haven't
proved lethal to humanity yet.

> Drugs are a replacement for Christ.

I have heard this claim quite a few times. Does anybody here know
who first came up with the ""God-shaped hole"" business?

You might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim
like this.

I don't know Eric, but I do not think it is wise to assume he has a less
joy-filled and abundant life because he holds certain beliefs.

230,"Hi. I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about
the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).

1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?
     What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're ""in committee"".
     How close is that to being made law?

2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important
   differences I missed?

3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:
  A. S414 doesn't specify an ""appeals"" process to wrongful denial during
     the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals
     process once the required instant background check system is established,
     but not before).
  B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving
     using existing records (so who would I sue in ""A"" above to have an
     inaccurate record corrected?)
  C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person
     can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an
     immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.
     But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a ""threat"", nor does
     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception
     statement.
True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?

4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a ""clean"" record from
   buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?
   At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?

   'Seems at min. a ""gun counting"" scheme would be needed
   (e.g., ""John Doe owns N guns"").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised
   to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun
   registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.

Please comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current
legislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits
of any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.",16,hi  i ve finished reading s     several questions brady bills  s    hr           are  current versions brady bill  status bills  i ve heard they re  in committee   close made law     s    hr     seem fairly similar  important differences missed     s    seems serious loopholes  a  s    doesn t specify  appeals  process wrongful denial waiting period  civil lawsuit     s    appeals process required instant background check system established  before   b  police explicitly liable mistakes denying approving using existing records  so would sue  a  inaccurate record corrected   c  s    includes exception to waiting period clause person convince local chief law enforcement officer  cleo  immediate threat life  life household member  s    doesn t say exactly considered  threat   place limit long cleo takes issue exception statement  true  misunderstood   holes     s     what s stop person  clean  record buying guns  grinding serial numbers  selling crooks  minimum  additional laws needed prevent this   seems min   gun counting  scheme would needed  e g    john doe owns n guns    so  s    passes  wouldn t surprised see legislation stricter  harder to forge i d  s plus national gun registration  justified need make brady bill work  please comment  i m mainly interested specific problems current legislation  i don t mean start general discussion merits any all waiting period bills ever proposed ,politics

We'll let you live, but just this once....

There's more to a real ""storage"" scope than just a long-persistence
phosphor.  Actually, the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all;
what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor,
which becomes charged as the electron beam intially ""writes"" the trace.
With the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level ""flood""
electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor
which are next to the ""written"" areas on the storage screen.  There are
some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage
tube, and the stored trace tends to ""bloom"" with time. 

Of course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the current
digital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in a
frame-buffer memory anyways.

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS


                          The Briefing Room


 10:10 A.M. EDT
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon 
to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out 
the first pitch.
	     
	     Q	  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not 
Amtrack.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's 
going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.
	     
	     Q	  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to 
break the logjam with  ??? Senate?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are 
discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, 
and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point 
that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs 
to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for 
summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the 
important programs that will put people back to work right away this 
summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be 
passed.
	     
	     Q	  Will he compromise, that's the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions 
are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and 
Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President 
believes his jobs program should go forward.
	     
	     Q	  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 
billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise 
being offered by --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being 
offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right 
now, let's see what happens today.
	     
	     Q	  Would he go that far -- no matter what the 
Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per 
year?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his 
program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be 
willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to 
come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's 
see what happens.
	     
	     Q	  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has 
happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order 
to get a vote?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more 
intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in 
doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the 
Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the 
President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, 
real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no 
question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative 
activity over the last few days.
	     
	     Q	  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package 
through?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the 
conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.
	     
	     Q	     prepared to compromise --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen 
to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting 
with Senator Dole. 
	     
	     Q	  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's 
been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.
	     
	     Q	  How?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record 
time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by 
$500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for 
important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong 
passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a 
minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock 
and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that 
he is not succeeding overall.
	     
	     Q	  He can't beat this, can he?
	     
	     Q	  The fact is they can do that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop 
action.  There's no question about that.
	     
	     Q	  What are you going to do about it?
	     
	     Q	  George, what do you know about these alleged notes 
taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears 
that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that 
when they say yes they mean no?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete 
misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the 
conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring 
President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime 
Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's 
belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  
I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and 
etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where 
he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese 
were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.
	     
	     Q	   Are you saying that the President said that when 
the Japanese say yes they mean no?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the 
exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say 
something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime 
Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.
	     
	     Q	  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the 
Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and 
there appears to be --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the 
Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It 
does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of 
view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that 
there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up 
but I'm not positive.
	     
	     Q	  George, was the specific comment that was made 
specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general 
observation on Japanese etiquette?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --
	     
	     Q	  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that 
has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, ""when the 
Japanese say yes they mean no.""
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean 
I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific 
comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific 
finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that 
Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.
	     
	     Q	  Was he saying it facetiously first?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual 
observation.
	     
	     Q	  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to 
clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President 
spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but 
I'm not sure exactly how many.
	     
	     Q	  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're 
making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got 
the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that 
it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no 
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the 
Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure 
there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is 
on.
	     
	     Q	  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they 
may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese 
is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two 
days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime 
Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. 
position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the 
Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's 
commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a 
constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to 
hear that.
	     
	     Q	  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq 
for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. 
policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary 
Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have 
reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance 
with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.
	     
	     Q	     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, 
Saddam can't stay in office?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our 
judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with 
the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that 
we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will 
continue to demand it.
	     
	     Q	  And are you concerned the Iran will become the 
dominant power in the area --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also 
spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect 
full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping 
support of terrorism.
	     
	     Q	  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in 
power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you 
base that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not 
complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the 
rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is 
not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  
He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding 
armaments.
	     
	     Q	  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he 
would be out of power?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on 
the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make 
it more difficult for him to stay in power.
	     
	     Q	  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it 
that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure 
politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence 
do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical 
difference with you that's in good faith?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times 
in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the 
fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now 
seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  
	     
	     Q	  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate 
Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to 
them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had 
one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate 
Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and 
thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -
-
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true 
that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the 
Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the 
introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate 
Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are 
continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who 
have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in 
what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is 
important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.
	     
	     Q	     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats 
alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it 
through?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is 
no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can 
frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  
You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going 
and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.
	     
	     Q	     going to rethink the way you attempt to get 
other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of 
the summer?
	     
	     Q	     work with Republicans and try to woo some 
Republicans into your camp?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to 
look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the 
President's intiatives?
	     
	     Q	  But on this one -- how are you going to do it 
differently than you did it on this one because on this one you 
really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear 
that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and 
could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  
Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for 
particular votes?  When you have to go through --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and 
understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the 
President's going to continue to reach out when he can.
	     
	     Q	  You don't have any regrets then about the way you 
have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your 
approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this 
experience?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like 
his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue 
to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, 
there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with 
them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this 
case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around 
a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.
	     
	     Q	  They're being denied any other legislative means of 
putting their proposals forward.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --
	     
	     Q	     any ideas.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being 
defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.
	     
	     Q	     to present them.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean 
they get the votes --
	     
	     Q	     that theirs can be passed though by the 
parliamentary rules under which they're playing.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in 
support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.
	     
	     Q	  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration 
backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?
	     
	     Q	     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for 
Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of 
grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at 
some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about 
anything recently.
	     
	     Q	     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the 
President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be 
some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the 
President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider 
something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President 
appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a 
special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around 
the California economic situation, including the situation in Los 
Angeles.  
	     
	     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles 
by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, 
Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD 
Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits 
by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I 
wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to 
California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is 
concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy 
decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities 
which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to 
watch it.
	     
	     Q	  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also 
supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a 
group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball 
management.  Does the President have a position on that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received 
correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson 
has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  
He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in 
baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the 
President intends to continue to go to the ball game.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see 
Reverend Jackson while he's out there?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see 
them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has 
raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, 
even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.
	     
	     Q	  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball 
game?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe 
the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an 
informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to 
the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining 
his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the 
President read it.
	     
	     Q	  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the 
managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be 
there, and is he going to meet with the President?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.
	     
	     Q	  What is the Mubarak schedule?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is 
coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a 
lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice 
President Gore.
	     
	     Q	  And joint statements tomorrow --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, 
yes.
	     
	     Q	  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did 
warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist 
activities?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, 
I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been 
general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a 
long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I 
mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there 
was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  
The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also 
reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.
	     
	     Q	  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, 
apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, 
forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at 
the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in 
their attempts to get some kind of action.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would 
agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did 
say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a 
network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate 
action.  But there was no specific information on this specific 
operation at all.
	     
	     Q	  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the 
law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have 
received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in 
not pursuing some kind of --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.
	     
	     Q	  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing 
mention in the news conference yesterday --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your 
question.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted 
action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what 
does the U.S. do next?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going 
to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our 
allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways 
to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an 
agreement.
	     
	     Q	  George, why do you think sanctions is still an 
option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the 
leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait 
you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day 
said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any 
time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When 
does no mean no and you have to do something different?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something 
different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the 
U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to 
try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every 
opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.
	     
	     Q	  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? 
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something 
that is under consideration.
	     
	     Q	  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's 
condition, how he's doing?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.
	     
	     Q	  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think 
we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning 
after the Mubarak visit.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going somewhere for Easter?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.
	     
	     Q	  What more can you tell us about the additional aid 
to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with 
the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  
I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their 
delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the 
Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the 
next several weeks.
	     
	     Q	  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude 
of the one announced Sunday?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the 
magnitude.
	     
	     Q	  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where 
do you stand on that --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, 
he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week 
and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this 
week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a 
hard look at it.
	     
	     Q	  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White 
House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the 
congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll 
be able to get our own researchers working as well.
	     
	     Q	  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a 
probability than a possibility?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under 
discussion.
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter 
of time and -- for months before that happens.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's 
something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working 
with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll 
continue to review other matters.
	     
	     Q	  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule 
this week?  Any travel?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I 
don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right 
now.
	     
	     Q	  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish 
American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference 
of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National 
Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  
We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate 
discussions.
	     
	     Thanks.

[...]

   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION
   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What
   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.

   [Reproduced without permission]

	   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,
	where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under
	the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,
	presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if
	a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group
	of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and
	sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after
	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.
	   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a
	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.
	However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers
	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did
	actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not
	necessarily go hand in hand.
	   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining
	the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.
	And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the
	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins
	University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-
	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in
	the amount of food eaten afterward.

	   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing
	cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a
	host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government
	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing
	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.
	Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and
	after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm
	that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the
	Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with
	monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's
	Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration
	have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a
	clean bill of health.
	   Granted, the FDA has set forth an ""acceptable daily intake"" of
	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed
	the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take
	in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of
	aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,
	or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...
	A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams
	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups
	of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content
	of selected foods omitted]
	   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away
	from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called
	phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000
	to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential
	amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child
	consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause
	such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with
	PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other
	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning ""Phenylketonurics:
	Contains Phenylalanine.""

Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin.
50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging.
That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year,
but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.

I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's
nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP
to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release
is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming
I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.

If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar
could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff
Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.

246,"Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.

For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game,

With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform, a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.

Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
Alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hell
is he thinking.

Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented
how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre said
he liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year,
what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most every
team in the league.

Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate, 
The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home,

When I was at the Texas Star Party a few years ago, the sky was so dark
that Venus did, indeed, cause light pollution until it set.

Even if the billboard were dark it could cause a problem.  Imagine observing an

I would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might
wait until I express an opinion before deciding I should be flamed for it.
As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks
on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you
count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally
think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires
organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces.
Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was
so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone
organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause
for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the
'Zionist' camp.

>Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking.

Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start
with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something.
And the previous posters were wrong, no?

>Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets
>against Northern israel.  Where does uprising end and war begin?

Again I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think
war requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command
and plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you
sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds
like war to me. Stone throwing does not.

As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  ""multi-headed""
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even
multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,
a Sun with a cg4 display).  ""multi-screen"" and ""multi-display"" would,
if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning
of ""multi-display"" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
""multi-screen"" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.

""zaphod"" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen.

> Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at
most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays
on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can
be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a
limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation
inherent to X.

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing
about X.

Yes it is, as has been evidenced by the previous two stages
of withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops.
Currently the troops are kept at a level consistent with light
and armored patrols.  No permanent installations have been
built in the area, nor are any planned.

As to the prodigal ""water question"",  you can continue to waste
your time looking for non-existent proof, or you can accept the

It depends which of those territories you refer to.
In general, settlers were moved into the territories because
at the time, in the context of the situations, it seemed the
logical move.  This is not to say that views don't change
or that mistakes are not made.  Currently, I would say that
the only ""disputed territory"" that does not appear to be temporary
is that of Eastern and northern Jerusalem.

There certainly are muslims who *do not* believe that their dream of 
a global Islamic community should be achieved through force. There are, 
however, others (and, they are often far more visible/vocal than the 
former) who *do* accept the establishment of global Islam through force. 
I  would *not* feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing 
""Islamicization"" through peaceful means, nor by Jews advocating the same
approach. Those advocating force as a means of expanding their side's
power are certainly a threat.

To Palestinians, Israel is doing just that; maintaining its dominance
of those *outside* its own ""group"". If I am told that ""I am not one of
you"" but you then impose your control on me, damn right you are a threat.
If I am a member of a non-muslim minority *inside* the Islamic
world and *actively did not* accept my ""minority"" status, I *would also 
certainly* see Islam's domination as having been acheived, and maintained, 
through the powerful coercive force all majorities wield over minorities
within their ranks.

Ah, in the _cosmic_ sence.. but who lives in the cosmic sence?
Not me! Cosmicly, we don't even exist for all practical purposes.
I can hardly use the Cosmic Sence Of Stuff as a guide to life.
It would just say: ""don't bother.""

Luckily for mortals, there are many sences of scale you can talk
about. In a human sence, you can have big purposes.

But the influence of Aristotle, Confucious, Alexander, Ceasar and
countless others is still with us, although their works have perished.

But they have changed to course of history, and while humanity exists,
their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing, even if they
are utterly forgotten.

>Mankind itself will one day perish.

One day, surely. (well, unless you believe in the Second Coming, which
I do not)

But in that time we can make a difference.

In the end. But it must be the end; until then, there is all the
point you can muster. And when that end comes, there will be nobody
to ask, ""Gee, I don't think James Sledd's deeds are gonna make
much of a difference, ulitmately, ya know?"".

But they will have already have made a difference, great or small,
before the end.

Why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile?

I don't doubt it. But I have thought about the cosmic scale. And
it does not seem to mean much to us, here, today.

>To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.

I would not find this comforting. But perhaps it is merely my
definitions. Here's what I think the relevant terms are:

""Reality""	That which is real.
""Illusion""	That which is not real, but seems to be.
""Real""		Objectively Existing

For ""reality"" to be an ""illusion"" would mean, then:

That which is real is not real, but seems to be.

Or:

That which objectively exists, does not objectively exist, but
does seem to objectively exist.

From which we can conclude, that unless you want to get a
contradiction, that no things objectively exist.

But I have a problem with this because I would like to say
that *I* objectively exist, if nothing else. Cogito Ergo Sum
and all that.

Perhaps you do not mean all that, but rather mean:
""Objective Reality is Unreachable by humans.""

Which is not so bad, and so far as I know is true.

>  That the
>true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.

Have on. If reality is an illusion, isn't True Reality an illusion
too? And if True Reality is spirit, doens't that make Spirit an Illusion
as well?

If I am not distinctly confused, this is getting positively Buddhist.

>  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn
>and grow, and our souls mature.

That is one hell of a statement, although perhaps true.

Do you mean to imply that it was *intended* to be so? If so,
please show that this is true. If not, please explain how this
can give a purpose to anything.

> That gives a purpose to my little purposes,

How does it do that?

Wouldn't the world=school w/ intent idea make the world a preparation for
some *greater* purpose, rather than a purpose in itself.

> and takes some of the pressure off.

What pressure?

>  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms
>if you're really just here to learn.

It is not necessary to be a success in human terms, unless your
goals either include doing so or require doing so before they
themselves can be achived.

Indeed, many people have set goals for themselves that
do not include success in human terms as _I_ understand it. Check
out yer Buddhist monk type guy. Out for nirvana, which is not
at all the same thing.

Why is learning to love a goal? What happens if you fail in this
goal? To you? To God? To the mysterious Purpose?

I'll have a crack at that.

(1) The nature of eternal life is neatly described by its name: It is
the concept of life without death, life without end.

(2) No. We can put together word to describe it, but we cannot imagine it.

(2a) No metaphor is adequate next to eternity; if it were we could not
understand it either. (or so I suspect)

266,"I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS
    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities, aired on Tuesday
    April 13. For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate
    points.

    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of
    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the
    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:

    - It was alleged that:"" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological
    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of
    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. ""!
    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives 
    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology
    in Iran after revolution.

    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors
    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen
    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in
    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and
    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.

    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi
    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most
    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total
    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million
    dead left from the war.

    - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For
    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: "" It hurts me to
    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda."" The 
    translator says: "" It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly 
    research.""!

    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought
    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to 
    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran's
    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in
    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.

    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of 
    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the
    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed
    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account
    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its
    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the
    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries
    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones
    in scientific and industrial efforts.

    4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as
    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from
    Iran's different sites. They say: ""We are not sure if the places visited
    by IAEA are the real ones or not"" !, or "" We can not rely on IAEA's
    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear
    activities before"" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build
    nuclear weapons!

    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the
    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,
    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking
    from the absolute knowledge!

       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their
    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to
    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs
    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.

I disagree.  People marry each other.  When they commit fully to each
other as life partners, they are married.  The ceremony may assist in
emphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing.
God knows our hearts.  He knows when two have committed themselves to
be one, he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully
giving ourselves to another.  The way I see it, you'd have to be living

Good statement! Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact
social morals? Should morals be based on social rules? On ancient
religious doctrines? It seems there will *NEVER* be a common and single
denominator for defining morals, and as such defining absolute
and objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have 
this incredible talent of creative thinking.

Or, _documentation_ for the program ;-).  A lot of shareware out there is 
very similar in the approach - send in your money, and you get 
documentation, and a free upgrade to the latest version.  Perhaps even 
support of some small degree.  Whatever you want to offer that is ""better"" 
than the circulating version.

It doesn't really hurt legit users.  Shareware is still much cheaper than 
the alternatives.

You could use DOS 6 to do this partly.  You can set up different config.sys
and autoexec.bat commands for each user, and they just have to select their
menu option on bootup.  Then you can have the autoexec.bat copy the win.ini
and system.ini files and change directories for them.  When they exit windows,
it can copy back generic .ini files if you want.

I have the local bus card also, and don't have any such problems with it
now, but this is the second card I've gotten - the first card didn't work
in VGA mode correctly.  Maybe they still have some quality control problems.
I would suggest checking with ATI (I went through the vendor I bought the
card from since the problem showed up immediately).  I never was able to
get through to ATI's technical support number.  

I sure like the way the card performs though.  I have the 2MB ATI ultra
pro - local bus, and it is fast even in 1024x768x16bpp mode.

Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much
as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning
the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that
this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win
in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first
instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch
it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.

I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against 
visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the
field.

Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or
not.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his
first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win.

Oh PULLEEZE!

It's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is
generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been
in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with
pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were
virtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better
pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty
hopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're
dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a
purse.

If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the
manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think
manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's
an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described
what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the
need for functional women's clothing.  The manufactuing industry
lost millions.

From a woman who would rather buy men's clothing WITH decent pockets and
long legs and high waists than women's clothing without....

You're admitting a lot more than that.  You are admitting that
your morals are situational.   You are admitting that the actions
of other people and the situation you are in help to determine
how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions.

If you employ X degree of force, that's not moral, but if you employ
X degree of force, but previously someone else has employed Y degree
of force, and the situation is thus-and-so, that *is* moral.

This is quite different from saying ""Employing force on other people
is immoral, period.   Unfortunately, from time to time we are obliged
to do this immoral thing for reasons of self-preservation, and so
we have to bear the moral consequences of that.

There's only one physical size for VRAM SIMMs (unlike DRAM SIMMs which 
come in many, many sizes and pinouts), although they do come with 
differing amounts of VRAM on them.  The ones you need are 256KB SIMMs, are 
organized as 128K x 16, and have two 128K x 8 VRAM chips on them.  This is 
the only size which the Quadra and Centris machines can use.

Two.

Both SIMM slots must be filled; putting a SIMM in only one slot does 
nothing for you.

80 ns for the Q800 and C650, 100 ns for the C610.

There are certain VRAM chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible 
with the Quadra and Centris video hardware.  Make sure that the source you 
get them from guarantees compatiblity.  In general, if it works in a Q950,
it will work in a Q800.

Those of us who have actually made semi-autos (full-autos are easier)
are getting quite a giggle out of this.  I'd estimate that 5% of
the people at my high school couldn't do it.  (I was one of the
few who failed shop.)  People who have actually seen me do mechanical
work would probably say that 1% is more like it.

Starting with even 90% of the population, you can be sure that
""enough"" people will be motivated.

How much is ""through the nose""?  After all, we know quite a bit
about how much a gun is worth to a criminal, so if that is dwarfed
by the price demanded by the ""bad"" part of that 90%....

The relevant economic analysis has been made.  The ""profit"" of
gun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals
out of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated.
That analysis ignored some ""improvements"" in the criminal gun
market that could make them even cheaper.  (They're not efficiently
used now, but a ""loaner"" set up would drive the value still higher
without affecting criminal use.)

A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at
full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you want
less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable
you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This
requires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could
probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply
instruction and a few other DSP things.

If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a
second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000
8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1
compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about
V.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work.
Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need
sampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a
PC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap
- you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the
SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't
sample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation
a bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be
required.

The only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the
SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that
I don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can't
estimate how fast a PC you'd need.

   CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES (published book) you'll find accounts of the
   massacres there including Deir Yassen,
   though with the numbers of massacred men, children and women are 
   greatly minimized.

As per request of Hasan:

From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:

[pp. 225-227]

    ""Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the
story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized
throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had
four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was
nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab
troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting
was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated
throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian
population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the
battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed
at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,
children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the
slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw
away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own
risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants
obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their
stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy
was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent
testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to
overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the
civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable
casualties.

    ""The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of
revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We
never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in
accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am
convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single
unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw
stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do
well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].

    ""In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency
found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.
Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise
ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise
ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the
bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal
superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews
were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of
'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave
of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'

    ""The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the
result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.
Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the
Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.
Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main
road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the
Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the
rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even
before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir
Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the
way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir
Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the
conquest of Haifa.""


[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) ""To counteract the loss
of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at
Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by
Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish
officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this
Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced
to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of
evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of
terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at
the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen
battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie
is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.""",17,article      apr                thunder mcrcim mcgill edu  hasan mcrcim mcgill edu writes  check menahem begin dairies  published book  you ll find accounts massacres including deir yassen  though numbers massacred men  children women greatly minimized  per request hasan   the revolt   menachem begin  dell publishing  ny         pp            apart military aspect  moral aspect story dir yassin  village  whose name publicized throughout world  sides suffered heavy casualties  four killed nearly forty wounded  number casualties nearly forty percent total number attackers  arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times heavy  fighting thus severe  yet hostile propaganda  disseminated throughout world  deliberately ignored fact civilian population dir yassin actually given warning us battle began  one tenders carrying loud speaker stationed entrance village exhorted arabic women  children aged leave houses take shelter slopes hill  giving humane warning fighters threw away element complete surprise  thus increased risk ensuing battle  substantial number inhabitants obeyed warning unhurt  leave stone houses   perhaps confusion  fire enemy murderous   number casualties bears eloquent testimony  men compelled fight every house  overcome enemy used large numbers hand grenades  civilians disregarded warnings suffered inevitable casualties   the education gave soldiers throughout years revolt based observance traditional laws war  never broke unless enemy first thus forced us  accordance accepted custom war  apply reprisals  convinced  too  officers men wished avoid single unnecessary casualty dir yassin battle  throw stones denunciation conquerors dir yassin     would well cloak hypocrisy       in connection capture dir yassin jewish agency found necessary send letter apology abdullah  mr  ben gurion  moment great political emotion  called  the wise ruler seeks good people country    wise ruler   whose mercenary forces demolished gush etzion flung bodies heroic defenders birds prey  replied feudal superciliousness  rejected apology replied jews blame believe existence  dissidents   throughout arab world world large wave lying propaganda let loose  jewish attrocities    the enemy propaganda designed besmirch name  result helped us  panic overwhelmed arabs eretz israel  kolonia village  previously repulsed every attack haganah  evacuated overnight fell without fighting  beit iksa also evacuated  two places overlooked main road  fall  together capture kastel haganah  made possible keep open road jerusalem  rest country  too  arabs began flee terror  even clashed jewish forces  happened dir yassin  invented dir yassin  helped carve way decisive victories battlefield  legend dir yassin helped us particular saving tiberias conquest haifa        a footnote  the revolt   pp          to counteract loss dir yassin  village strategic importance  arab headquarters ramallah broadcast crude atrocity story  alleging massacre irgun troops women children village  certain jewish officials  fearing irgun men political rivals  seized upon arab gruel propaganda smear irgun  eminent rabbi induced reprimand irgun time sift truth  evil  however  good came  arab propaganda spread legend terror amongst arabs arab troops  seized panic mention irgun soldiers  legend worth half dozen battalions forces israel   dir yassin massacre  lie still propagated jew haters world  ,vehicles

Troglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level.
The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in 
their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and 
independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged 
in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed 
genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia 
and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and 
fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry 
during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, 
rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the 
Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians 
engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal 
they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million 
Turks and Kurds before and during World War I.

And, you don't pull nations out of a hat.

of the Aryan 'Super-Race;' 

c) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves 
with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, 

d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 20,000 members which fought side

Absolutely.  I just meant that no secure *dedicated* crypto device has

     The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise
     before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against 
     that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox
     belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16), 
     the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).

     The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent
     on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was
     contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the 
     cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of 
     the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.

There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can
cause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies
widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults
pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia)
is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae
is the most common cause.

What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis,
which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in
both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism
is also called the ""meningococcus"", and is the source of the
common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in
the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases),
the organism typically causes death within a day. 

This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats
of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different
ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case. 

Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts
of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.

Sorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitis
is a huge topic, and sci.med can't do it justice.

One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now,
you may not be able to later.  This isn't a case of reaching over and
flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly

You implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to
help the ""butchers of their choice"".  Since the primary targets of help are
Muslim victims of ""ethnic cleansing"", you imply that such Muslim victims are
butchers.

>1) People become butchers by butchering.  There have been atrocities on all

This implies both sides are equal.  True, it may sometimes be difficult or
impossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that
victims do not exist.  Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities
on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans?

>These people have been butchering each other for centuries.  When one

Yes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not
be ""ethnic cleansed"".  The Serbians want to ""ethnic cleanse"" the Muslims.  It
is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the
things that the two sides want are not equivalent.

I recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying
that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to
Somalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider
unworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to
the opposite place than that predicted by the theory.

For that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to
help the Serbs.  After all, they're Christian, and the Muslims are not.  If
the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are
less like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us?
Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think?

Probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in
emphasis.  Weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days
a week in a business), and instead of American Atheists, we would have
similar, religious organizations.  A persons religious belief seems more
as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions.
Of course, people would have to come up with more fascinating 
rationalizations for their actions, but that could be fun to watch...

It seems to me, that for most people, religion in America doesn't matter
that much.  You have extreemists on both ends, but a large majority don't
make too much of an issue about it as long as you don't.  Now, admittedly,
I have never had to suffer the ""Bible Belt"", but I am just north of it
and see the fringes, and the reasonable people in most things tend to be
reasonable in religion as well.

I thought the implication was that the prince destroyed one fourth of the

323,"Smythe Division
---------------

Vancouver vs. Winnipeg - Jets in 7
The Jets have played the Canucks tough the last three games.  Everyone is
healthy for the Jets.  I'm biased.  :)

Calgary vs. Los Angeles - Flames in 6
From what I have seen, the Kings have looked flat lately.  I just can't see
them getting by the Flames.

Final- Jets in 6.
The Jets haven't lost to the Flames in '93.  They will, but it will be a
close series that will come down to how well Roberts has recovered.  I
don't think he'll be 100%, and while it will help, it won't be enough.

Norris Division
---------------

Chicago vs. St. Louis/Minnesota
Chicago in 6 against the Blues, 7 against the Stars.  

Detroit vs. Toronto - Wings in 6.
The Wings should be able to shutdown Gilmour and Andreychuk.  Chelvadae is
more experienced than Potvin.

Final - Hawks in 7.  Brutal series.  Probert and Chelios will go at it.
Belfour is better than Chelvadae, IMHO.

Conference Final - Hawks in 6.  It hurts, but the Hawks are more experienced,
and that will carry them through to the final.

Prince of Wales Conference
--------------------------

Adams Division
--------------

Boston vs. Buffalo - Bruins in 6.
B's can check, Juneau is darn good, and Neely.  The Sabres rely too much
on Lafontaine and Mogilny.

Quebec vs. Montreal - Montreal in 7.
Classic battle, the inexperience will hurt the Nords, this year.

Final - Bruins in 5.  Habs will be hurting from their series with the Nords,
and Boston has been able to control the scorers on the Habs.

Patrick Division
----------------

Pittsburgh vs Islanders/Devils - Pens in 5.
One word.  Mario.

Washington vs. Devils/Islanders - Caps in 6 / Devils in 7.
I think the Caps can beat the Isles, but not the Devils.  Tabaracci has been
strong in goal, and if he plays like last year, he could carry the team.
It doesn't matter, though.

Final - Pens in 5.  Two more words.  Stevens.  Jagr.

Cup Final - Pens in 6.  Three last words.  Tocchet.  Murphy.  Barrasso.

The only thing I don't like about this is that the Pens woofers are going to
be out in full force again.  (I don't mean the regular Penguin fans...it's
just like the bunch around here that if these predictions are true will post
like nuts while the Jets are winning, but we won't hear from again when they

Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base.
They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem
spot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly
promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they
want to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!

""A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his
 recent offensive level of performance.""  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in
 the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger
 in two short years.  The rule doesn't apply to perceived ""superstars"", who
 get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead.  Greg Olson is probably
 considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.

One could make the same sort of argument in other cases.  Pete Rose, in
pursuing Ty Cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media
magnet).  The Reds made a lot of money off that; they also wasted the prime
of Eric Davis.  That may be ""good business"", but that doesn't mean I don't
loathe them for it.

You didn't read to carefully.  VLB-IDE uses the same connection mechanism

On mine, for one thing.  SCSI blows IDE out of the water, hands down.  If
IDE has better throughput, why isn't it used on workstations and file
servers?

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives
at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.

I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I
haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because
nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:
easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or
Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.

On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for
expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The
following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:

A (partial?) list:
	1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them 
	concurrently.
	2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac
	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice
	with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)
	3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For
	instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor
	212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will
	work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the
	termination, plug it in, and away it goes.
	4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that
	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is
	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:
	to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very
	noticable, as many things can be going on at once.

One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the
ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with
little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've
added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to
have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive

Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.

IDE does not do DMA.  This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk
interface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the
controller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main
memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not
compatible.

Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about
ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE
drives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE
did DMA there would be trouble.

(BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the
last report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it
would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)",3,article      apr               julian uwo ca  wlsmith valve heart rri uwo ca  wayne smith  writes    article  wayne   uv amtower spacecoast org  wayne amtower spacecoast orgx newssoftware  grn     f            mike schwartz   michael b  smith writes         still want know intrinsically better       than ide  isa bus  comes multi tasking os s      managing data single scsi hard drive         a scsi controller transfers data dma allows cpu request data    from hard drive continue working controller gets data    and moves memory      ide also uses dma techniques  believe floppy controller also uses dma    a d boards also use dma  dma big deal  nothing   directly scsi  ide dma  it s like te pc hard disk interface  controller moves sector buffer memory controller card  cpu moves data buffer main memory it s needed  ide doesn t work way  it s compatible  heck  ide used dma  you d hear kinds complaints isa bus systems   m ram working ide drives    m dma addressing limit isa bus  ide dma would trouble   btw  dma enabling signals ide cable spec  last report heard never implemented  would require different kind ide adapter different drivers  ,computers

     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is
     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not

     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then
     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than
     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say
     ""well, Satan is just metaphorical,"" but then you
     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is
     not some metaphor for something else.

     I say this because there are many, many instances of
     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in 
     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the
     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is
     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know
     one is metaphorical and not the other.

     Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's
     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were
     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe
     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a 
     case where someone does believe in God, but by
     religious standards, they are ""evil.""  If Bobby
     does see this, let him address this question also.

	But, this just shows then that painful execution is not considered 
""cruel"" and unusual punishment. This shows that ""cruel"" as used in the 
constitution does NOT refer to whether or not the punishment causes physical 
pain.
	Rather, it must be a different meaning.

Oh, but they definitely can be.  Please look at Colossians 3:5-10 and

Please, re-think and re-read for yourself, Joe.  Again, the issue is
self-control especially over feelings and actions, for our actions stem
from our feelings in many instances.  As for God giving in to his anger,

Good question.  I don't have a nice concise answer, though.  What about the
child whose parents are crushed emotionally because he/she starts a carerr
doing something they greatly dislike.  It is the same kind of harm, and
is probably ""caused"" by the same thing:  The desire of the child to be

339,"seanna@bnr.ca (Seanna (S.M.) Watson) asks:
 > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?
 
       The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. 
Easter (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan
whore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is ""what is
the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?""  When phrased
that way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately
apparent what my objection to ""celebrating"" her would be.
 
 > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.
 
      No, you are thinking perhaps of ""Ressurection Sunday"" I think. 
(Though I'm not too crazy about the word ""Sunday"", but I certainly like
this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)
     For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of
First Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following
the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern
parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection
on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all
over the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday
following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical
methods?
 
 > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate

      So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore
goddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that
whore out of the discussion.

       Yes, I have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave

       Fine by me.  And while we are at it, the left-handed people are
both ""sinister"" and ""gauche"" so we probably will have some objections from
that quarter as well.

      Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon's ""slave""
returned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon
Philemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different ""rules"" that
apply to them as well?  Or if there is no more ""male and female"" can Adam
and Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are
differences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in
Messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.
 
---------------------------------------

[I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it
seems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is
new -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.

I'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this
argument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of
the week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some
Christians prefer to refer to ""first day"", ""second day"", etc.  However
the majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question
seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows
as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when
they use it is different.

Indeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be
dangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the
celebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convince
them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run
the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.

  There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago
about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)
As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult
to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:
  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out 
    of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own
    breathing effort (let alone anything else)

  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is
    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled
    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)
    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done
    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen
    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough
    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.

  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough
    gas per unit volume. 

  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs
or interfere with their healing or anything like that...

343,"For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think
about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from 
Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated
at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to
the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay
pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used
a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.
	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front
fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube
frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to
do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two
vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing
follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.
The compressor is about 2"" in diameter and about 5"" long.
	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small
so there should be plenty of good places for it.
	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to
mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side
just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the
horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where
the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough
room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice
cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.
	The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out
about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look
closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight
ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).
	If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try
to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them
first.
	How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound
more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.
I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has
not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).
	I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though
they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping
the pedestrians on the sidewalk.
The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to
those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)

Then allow me to enlighten you, Rex. You see, there's a thing called a tie. 
A tie is worth one point (I know, I know. You're not good at math. But bear
with me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as 
getting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd
have two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also
have two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are
different.

352,"Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use
the net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this
religion does not take off, its founding members will be very important
historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become 
common.

The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional
morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's
accounts of the facts and historical events is correct.

For example,

Story of Adam and Eve:
Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited
supply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says
not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide 
in bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.
(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in
the bushes that might have angered God.)

Traditional Philosophy:
1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will
provide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This
is why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.
2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler 
and slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without 
question by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.

Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:
They were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God
told them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were
obligated to do whatever their ""Father"" said to.  Being forced to leave the 
Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.

Lessons from Traditional Interpretation:
1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.
2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read ""welfare"") is ideal.  Get-
ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.
3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.
4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and 
should do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for 
themselves.
5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from
learning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.

1990's philosophy:
1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless
named ""Hillary Clinton"" or ""Murphy Brown"".
2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people 
(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.

Interpretation of events based on current philosophy:
They were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge
rather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge
and (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-
selves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were 
REWARDED by being allowed into the ""real world.""

Lessons from new interpretation:
1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.
2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read ""welfare"") is at best
a temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn
is ideal.
3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.
4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and
should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and ""alter
or abolish"" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.
5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge
but should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children 
without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better
life for their children (and themselves).

I have tentatively named this new philosophy ""The Church of Eveism"" because
Eve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead
of its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly
a protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek 
knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the
decision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention
and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it 
until it was actively sought.

And I maintain:

Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that
they alone are their own masters, because they fear it; they are too
afraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  And so, by
their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs
under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the
darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.
These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded
at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And,
after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are,
they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places
they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the
world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their
successes.

They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the
narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under
a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great
-- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.

Do you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm
getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved
immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be
a difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the
long hike, but it's well worth it!

Look, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?  They're as much

Don't you see?  I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness

something as mega-powerful as what you're trying to get me to accept.

When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead
of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity
decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.

Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling
that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable
place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and
holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little
sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.

You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or
Zen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how
can you say you have an open mind?

>Sin is fun!  Let's

Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your
failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led
as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a
good life.

I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god
I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in
which case it's not really all that important.

 The idea I've gotten is that to christians, Hell is -- like Heaven --
 afterlife; i.e, you don't cease to exist, but are subjected to eternal 
 torture (well, that's the orthodox idea anyway; ""eternal death"" if you
 prefer that). Atheists don't believe in any sort of afterlife.

 I think it's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly
 not the equivalent of ceasing to exist. Some christian concepts are indeed
 metaphors, but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation. It is, of
 course, nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview 
 of modern age, but I fear the church will not accept it. Understandably, per-
 haps, because if you accept that Hell is a metaphor, then you're one step

But, the goal need not be a subjective one.  For instance, the goal of
natural morality is the propogation of a species, perhaps.  It wasn't
really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions
to this were necessary.  Intelligent animals have different needs than
the others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more
complicated than ""the law of the jungle.""  I don't think that

The Atari 2600 used a 6502 CPU, just like their entire 8-bit line
(400, 800,1200,1400, 1440, 130xe, 65xe computers, as well as the 5200
game machine). The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically
modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600
might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight
of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.

Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for
their games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I
would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking
with the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the
2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).
Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into
a RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to
backup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games could
be bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them
into a special RAM cartidge, and play them.

Anyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've got
two 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa
cartridges. Willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping and
handling. Don't play it anymore, since going to computers + Nintendo

361,"Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or
contribution to:

In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If
you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will
not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. 
The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle
(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of
the law is no excuse - they will get you too!

It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. 
Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF
from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!"" 
But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police
are writing citations right and left for people using radar
detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had
found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,
and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was
there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.

Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or
near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me
from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my
speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar
detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which
is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to
obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.

For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only
works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave
enlightment may be necessary.

So, the questions are -
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?
  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna?

But, those chips are probably inside a custom chip, (to make it smaller and
use less power) and the preset/data pins are not going to be available.
It would probably not be TTL but might be CMOS 
(wider operating voltage range), not that the tecnology would make 
much difference.
Plus the custom chip would probably be potted (encapsulated with epoxy).
Good luck.

For a VGA card these are the correct files but you can't just copy them

Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course,
in your termonology, God could not ""cease to exist.""  However, that is not what
death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see
that it signifies ""separation.""  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is
the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one
member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.  

I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived. 
She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my
""girlfriend"" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were
separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided
that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was
death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is
separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not
because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go
there.

When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in
that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He
was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued
on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and
unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us
do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh. 
You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to
you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.  

>Being Jesus was allegedly God, I doubt he could honestly feel
>     the pinpricks man dealt him...

This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct
knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.
 Jesus most certainly felt the ""pinpricks"" of life.  As the Scripture say:

Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our
weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without
sin.

The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes
when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine
to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  ""The Consciousness of
Christ.""  I have talked at length with a great many people about this
interesting study, including clh.  

It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually
suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we
do.  He ""grew in knowledge.""  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose
to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was ""led of the Spirit"" to such
an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and
Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him,
the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. 
That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was
living sequential history as you or I.  

Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion
and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than
not.

I was once a member of that club.  THe ""free thinker"" is a glorious ideal.  By
contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository
of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find
such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist
wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. 
But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his ""rational
doubt"" when in fact he was led to it by his ""faith"".  He must acknowledge that
while it is rational doubt for him as a ""free thinker"" to criticize the
Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize
him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no
faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.

Pascal pointed out that ""sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.
 Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.""  The fact that skeptics are not
skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must
believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or
even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a
measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define
himself only in negative terms, hence the term ""a""-theist.

Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In
my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. 
However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word,
every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication
speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make
sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.

That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism
is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out ""Look, your fly
is undone!""  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he
believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it
underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he
knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. 
The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on
presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before
it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and
critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective
and neutral.  In other words, another myth.  

Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is
something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can
be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are
our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for
absence.

Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had
been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first ""Highlander"" movie. 
But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of
God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic
theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His
prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you

375,"There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters.

The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as 

   (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2

This equation can be rewritten into the following form:  

   2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2

Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1

For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.

In 'Numerical Recipes in C' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.

The best fitting sphere will have 
- center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2)

We heard about this from a newspaper article.  Journalists and editors
always pick out the most interesting and sensational ""facts"" for our
delectation.  As the editor of the Sun once said: ""We never let the
facts get in the way of a good story"".  You must have noticed how
motorcyclists get treated by the press.  They thrive on hysteria,
ignorance, sensationalism and one-upmanship.  Unfortunately there's
not enough salt to keep taking a pinch of.

There is a (likely) veto proof majority in the house.  The Senate,
unfortunately, is a different story.  The Lt.Gov. has vowed that the bill will
not be voted on, and he has the power to do it.  In addition, the Senate is a
much smaller, and more readily manipulated body.

On ther other hand, the semi-automatic ban will likely not live, as at least
fifty per cent of the house currently opposes it, and it is VERY far down in
the bill order in the Senate (I believe it will be addressed after the CCW
bill).

DOS 5.0/6.0 cannot read the NTFS file system, although the NTFS file system
can read the FAT file system of DOS.  I have WindowsNT on a seperate
partition on my machine at home, and I can read my DOS disks from Windows NT,
but not vice-versa.

As far as the robustness of the file system, it seems to be very fast, and
I have yet to have a single problem with it.  That doesn't prove it's better
than the FAT system though.  Read the book 'Inside Windows NT,' it will give
you all the info you're looking for.

I don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy

Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and
lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel)
image to black and white dots.

So: if you have a PostScript printer, try:
	xwdtopnm <xwdfile> |	# convert to PPM
	[ppmtopgm |]		# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print
	pnmtops -noturn |	# .. to PostScript
	lpr			# print

pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care:
If you want your image to be 4"" wide, use:
	pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4
-noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it
	is high)
-width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below)
-scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a
	width less than 4"", and will thus be printed smaller than 4"" wide.
	If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4"", and
	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified

	In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,
	but it will not blow it up automatically.

I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of
the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone
decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper
algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly
difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able
to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a
description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out 
the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an
uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think
about design decisions made by other designers.

I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using
""tamperproof"" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive
and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that
there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication
of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these
supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely
reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot
bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that
""well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret,
isn't it?""

A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of 
that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than 
you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the 
printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the 
printer)

""Inkjet"".

Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter 
will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that 
are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.

HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the 
software package has no inkjet driver. 

There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a 
page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a 
laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers 
actually use this facility.

While shopping for a passenger helmet, I noticed that in many cases the
external dimensions of the helmets were the same from S through XL.  The
difference was the amount of inside padding.

My solution was to buy a large helmet, and construct a removable liner 
from a sheet of .5"" closed-cell foam and some satin (glued to the inside
surface).  The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion
with the liner in, and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with
the liner out.  Everyone else gets linered or not by best fit.

scanner errors and what have you.

The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so ""global""
adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or
rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.

So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for
removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of
points 

Reference(x,y) (the known true values)

DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)

DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)

what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to
DistortedData to remove the errors.

I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted
reference points as resulting from the projection of a ""bumpy"" 3d
surface, solving for the surface and then ""flattening"" it to remove
the errors in the other data points.

Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,
pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?

I sure hope so. Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must 
be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of 
Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to 
the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.

All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly
exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of 
Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the 
Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.

It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators
of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi
members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate
racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples. 

And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following 
ways:

1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility.

2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the 
veracity of the Turkish Genocide.

3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through
the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.

4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters
of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.

Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.

Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist
and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle 
of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians,
the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and 
consequently a number of governments and organizations have become 
supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

                       Gonorrhea -- Colorado, 1985-1992
                       ================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     The number of reported cases of gonorrhea in Colorado increased 19.9% 
from 1991 to 1992 after declining steadily during the 1980s. In comparison, in 
the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall 
decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in 
gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of 
this disease from 1985 through 1992. 
     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department 
of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, 
reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively 
(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics 
(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases 
with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% 
of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by 
age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or 
equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all 
reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the 
largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age 
group-specific rate (639 per 100,000). 
     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver 
metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the 
state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area 
occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods 
considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. 
     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among 
men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in 
the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits 
by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases 
diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, 
the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised 
94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among 
self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, 
respectively). 
     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, 
university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted 
to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea 
culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 
23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the 
fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). 
     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and 
Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks

Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado 
increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, 
the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for 
whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) 
(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 
1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases 
increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 
may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more 
complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH 
surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea 
cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories 
suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. 
However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning 
laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the 
gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. 
     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in 
Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a 
recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs 
(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area 
coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires 
further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated 
previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) 
-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom 
gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, 
and gang affiliation. 
     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the 
national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective 
19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for 
gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at 
greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-
specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as 
socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. 
     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, 
interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting 
partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at 
increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black 
males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio

announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in 
schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted 
primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to 
perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational 
interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of 
members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders 
and health-care providers.

            Impact of Adult Safety-Belt Use on Restraint Use Among
            Children less than 11 Years of Age -- Selected States,
                                 1988 and 1989

     Motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and 
young adults in the United States and account for more than 1 million years of 
potential life lost before age 65 annually (1). Child safety seats and safety 
belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 
states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety 
belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by 
an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major 
cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of 
occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for 
those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In 
addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to 
use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between 
adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints 
for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC 
analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this 
study. 
     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 
18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, 
random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury 
Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 
(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent 
was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for 
that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in 
this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than 
consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). 
Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software 
for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates 
and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined 
by p values of less than 0.05. 
     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six 
(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no 
law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, 
and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a 
vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse 
of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary 
enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a 
safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection

Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states 
used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. 
The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law 
requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law 
(no-law states). 
     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not 
consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and 
adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square 
test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus 
43.2%, respectively). 
     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 
year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than 
consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported 
high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age 
(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for 
adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-
occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% 
for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of 
consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult 
safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age 
groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). 
     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded 
that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, 
higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with 
increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated 
with increased adult safety-belt use (8). 

Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National 
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. 

Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others 
indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely 
to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these 
nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit 
other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater 
risk for motor-vehicle injury (10). 
     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with 
child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs 
should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low 
educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such 
programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve 
low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are 
directed at parents with young children. 
     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In 
addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as

they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, 
those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do 
not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety 
belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and 
safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may 
increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- 
the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the 
highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

                   Publication of CDC Surveillance Summaries
                   =========================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     Since 1983, CDC has published the CDC Surveillance Summaries under 
separate cover as part of the MMWR series. Each report published in the CDC 
Surveillance Summaries focuses on public health surveillance; surveillance 
findings are reported for a broad range of risk factors and health conditions. 
     Summaries for each of the reports published in the most recent (March 19, 
1993) issue of the CDC Surveillance Summaries (1) are provided below. All 
subscribers to MMWR receive the CDC Surveillance Summaries, as well as the 
MMWR Recommendations and Reports, as part of their subscriptions.

 SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES
                               IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC 
                        AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88 

     Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance 
systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects. 
     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance 
in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for 
the years 1983-1988. 
     Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program 
and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-
based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The 
prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-
1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan 
Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, 
sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. 
     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal 
alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the 
kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general 
diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand 
limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are 
probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these 
defects are relatively easy to diagnose. 
     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy 
termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, 
the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be 
related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene 
pool, or random variation. 
     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several 
collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in 
the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on 
the impact of prenatal diagnosis. Authors: Jane Schulman, Ph.D., Nancy

                      INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89

     Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza 
virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually 
from October through May. 
     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance 
conducted from October 1988 through May 1989. 
     Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices 
of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO 
collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza 
viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and 
territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. 
Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received 
throughout the year. 
     Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B 
viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency 
overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted 
over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices 
of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were 
similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of 
identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype 
increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the 
1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were 
reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza 
A(H1N1). 
     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of 
influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the 
importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since 
amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. 
     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced 
throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make 
informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual 
surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates 
for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.

                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies

Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-
ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been 
developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), 
embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, 
these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive 
technology (ART) procedures. 

Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or 
pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility 
management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to 
proceed with one of the ART procedures. 

Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility 
service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and 
Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in 
ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients 
in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the 
traditional therapies. 

The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our 
Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the 
realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: 

o in vitro 
o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube 
  transfer 
o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. 
This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed 
towards improved success of these technologies.

                           Future Areas of Research

In addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the 
management of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist 
couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary 
disease. 

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then 
subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA 
amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. 

There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by 
other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and 
hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ 
hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of 
which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit 
sex-linked disorders. 

The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that 
it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility 
of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth 
of affected children.

               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the
                           Management of Infertility

The following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona 
Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. 

     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our 
Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of 
unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and 
the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred 
to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under 
strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being 
processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our 
andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25

assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to 
perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically 
stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing 
hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo 
lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs 
obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic 
egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, 
we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our 
Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  
     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal 
deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male 
factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall 
success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per 
cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 
IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. 
     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is 
disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological 
factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well 
recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous 
ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle 
attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant 
of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an 
Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of 
traditional therapies. 
     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not 
been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs 
available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates 
significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; 
and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is 
unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our 
Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may 
be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that 
fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant 
proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, 
the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our 
program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs 
of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. 

     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, 
usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves 
introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian 
tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization 
occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, 
with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for 
transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26

which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such 
pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility 
and/or idiopathic infertility.    
     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 
indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained 
with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 
percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might 
expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our 
program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while 
substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the 
patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing 
a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing 
general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from 
obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, 
and the developmental competency of resultant embryos. 
     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial 
environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between 
January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT 
cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. 
     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when 
embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. 
This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for 
success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical 
issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated 
by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from 
both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs 
should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. 
     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, 
is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but 
who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in 
combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 
percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the 
procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under 
the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm 
through enzymatic digestion. 
     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 
percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly 
relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. 
Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques 
for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such 
efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology 
offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to 
establish conception.

I think its an attempt to show lives_saved v lives_lost; all other
 gun related crimes don't result in lives_lost.  On the other hand,
 its impossible to know how many of the successful self defenses 
 prevented lives from being lost.  In other words, the lives_lost
 is pretty clear [its the homicide and non negligent manslaughter
 number], while the lives saved is some percentage of the successful 
 self defenses.  Clearly that percentage doesn't have to be real 
 high to show that lives_saved > lives_lost.

As a semi-related point, check out Kleck's ""Point Blank"".  I believe
 it goes into some related areas; it also is well written and informative.

411,"A week or so ago, I posted about a problem with my SE/30:  I have 20 megs
or true RAM, yet if I set my extensions to use a large amount of memory
(total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder
comes up.  What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or
sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's
memory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and
so is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the
others until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods
mentioned above).

Well, here's my latest followup...  I ran NOWs System Profile and got
this information:

%%% Memory info %%%

Physical RAM size: 20480K.
Logical RAM size: 20480K.
Size of Low Memory Area: 8K.
Virtual Memory: Inactive.
Addressing mode: 32bit mode in use.
32 bit System zone: Absent.
Parity RAM: Not capable.
Growable System Heap: True.
Temporary memory support: Present.
Tempory Memory Support: Real and tracked.

They aren't functions, they are character arrays. The standard strings
are either defined as string constants or character pointers into
XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES. Your
libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it
undefined so simply recompile one or the other. It is probably worth
adding -DXTSTRINGDEFINES to your CFLAGS.

	Yes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may
well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but 
since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well
worth it to buy the Saturn.

	Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't 
make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally
do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up
the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-
car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.

>Isn't that saving money?

	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.  I'd rather pay
more for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs...

I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The many
verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been
shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)
Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion
of any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well
as a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses
and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We
must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the
interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with
them.",15,  one thinks homosexuality christianity compatible     ck   out    romans        corinthians       timothy        jude       ii peter         gen       lev          to name verses pertain homosexuality    christ s love    bryan whitsell waiting this  think question rephrased  many verses bible condem homosexuality  by beliefs  shoved throats homosexuals long time  well meaning   christians  question interpret verses  discussion issue  this issue  requires proof case well disproof opposing view  already familiar verses many proven condem homosexual behaviour  must establish reasons believing true based interpretation scriptures given someone come grips them ,religion

430,"Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the 
Powerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers:
(1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes
(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 
running at 15.87 Mhz.
(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a 
lot of memory.
(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors 
that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors 
sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell 
memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most 
memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether 
the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine 
California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - 
$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that 
are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.
(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an 
average access time of about 25 ms.
(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a 
backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move 
your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or 
non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.

Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay 
for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to 
sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about 
$650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for 
about $900. 

The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.

I'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got 
one they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright

I do agree with you, in a way.  The war on drugs has failed, but in my opinion,
that doesn't mean we have to give up.  Only change the tactics.

For instance, here are how some penalties should be changed.

Dealing Coke -- Death
Dealing Heroin -- Death
Dealing Pot -- Death
Dealing Crack -- Death

The list goes on and on!!!......

JUST KIDDING!!!

However, on a more serious note, I do believe that we should take some money 
away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border 
interdiction efforts.  (Don't think I'm going to say, ""spend it to educate 
people"", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on  
things like drug treatment programs.

I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually 
prescribe and addict his ""recommended"" dosage, and try to ween him off from it,
or cut the amount down to levels where it is ""acceptable"".  Sounds good so far 
from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out 
the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)

However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be 
bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a 
recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.

Due to advances in composite fuels, engines are now available for model
rockets using similar composites to SRB fuel, roughly 3 times more 
powerful than black powder motors.  They are even available in a reloadable
form, i.e. aluminum casing, end casings, o-rings (!).  The engines range
from D all the way to M in common manufacture, N and O I've heard of

It's got potential.  Instead of *.chemistry, how about splitting the

Maybe, maybe not.  A new graduate would obviously be well trained (but
perhaps without sufficient experience). A radiologist trained 10 or
15 years ago who has not kept his continuing education current is a 
whole 'nuther matter.  A OB who HAS trained in modern radiology technology
is certainly more qualified than the latter and at least equal to 
the former.

:) No...I was one of the lucky ones. Very little acne as a teenager. I
didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it
really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. 

Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp
thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under
the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day
vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it  
is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be
where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease 
on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating
meat).

Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm
water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will
help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it
softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with
oilyness. 

Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with
a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any
prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of
pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't
be an infection afterwards.

Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry
makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an
incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).

I agree, although I would have no idea how to go about doing it. But

Due to living in the Bay Area, I as unable to see Vancouver's victory over

Could someone please post a brief sonapsis (sp?) of waht happened.  How well
did each team play?  Were the cannucks deserving of the victory?

Also, could some kind soul please email me the end of season, individual

Indeed, CDs are bundled with it.
You usually get nine CDs with demos of applications, games, photos, etc.

446,"Now the bike is off warranty, I finally replaced the stock items on my
Softail Custom with the title ones. Installation was pretty easy in
both cases, even for a fairly non-mechanical chemist type dude like me!
 I discovered the limitations of my tool collection, but had fun buying
and making the requisite tools!

MC Ignitions Power Arc II Single Fire Ignition: easy to install, but
read the wiring diagram carefully!  Setting the static timing was a
piece of cake.  Once installed, I have found easier starting, smoother
idle, and more power, plus a more satisfying (to me) bass note in the
exhaust register...a lovely whompa-whompa-whompa idle  :-)
The folks at MC Ignitions were great in answering my dumb questions on
the phone..... a very helpful bunch of guys with a great product.

S&S Super E Carb: installation easy, once I hacked down an Allen wrench
to a small anough reach to get at the intake manifold bolts. Tunes like
a dream, just like they say!  The stock carb (non-adjustable) was so
lean that it was gasping and spluttering for gas sometimes, and even
backfiring into the intake manifold. The Super E is terrific, no
hesitation in any gear, and my plugs are a lovely tan color with no
need to rejet from the factory settings!

I know this may not seem like much to you grizzled veteran wrenchers
out there, but I had my bike in so many pieces this weekend I began to
get worried. But it all went back together again, and runs like a
dream, so I am feeling pretty happy.

Now all I have to do is install my BUB pipes and try to pass the NH
Noise Gestapo Test!

Yes - ignore the manual.  Just insert the evelope - don't use the keypad
to move it up.  The Windows driver sends a message to the printer that
tells it to load the envelope - if it is already loaded, it gets ejected
and the printer tries to load another.  The instructions in the manual
are for dumb DOS apps. that don't send the ""load envelople"" message.

In plain Motify using a dialog 'in-line' like this simply isn't done. You need
to set callbacks from the buttons/widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines
do the work. In the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic. 

XView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'Notify' box, which can
return a status in-line, it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event
driven style of an application.

were slower then  existent single processors.

What the argument was, though was that these new technologies promised either

I think that the DC-1  may g=fit into this same model.

ELV's can certainly launch more weight  then  a SSRT,  but 
an SSRT offers the prospect of  greater cycle times and  lower costs.

It is interesting that you posted those lyrics, because just the

since whenever I am approached by judgemental, pharisitical,

I have long hair, wear a black leather jacket, and listen to Black

and they come up speechless over those not very satanic lyrics.

I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some new
drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*
track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This
becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and
so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it
seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.

I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers
explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT
to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.

+      other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem,
+      DON'T put go32.exe within search path.

  *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.

  If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment
    GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256

  If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387

  **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.
                 Other drivers are not tested.
              2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits
                 display. You don't need to use vesa driver.
                 If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.
              3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display,
                 please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).
                 You can find vesa BIOS driver from :

(7) Detail:

   Initialization:
      Set default display type to highest display type.
      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).

   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this
      menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy
      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like
      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.
+       The header line in 'read' menu includes ""(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)"".
+         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.
      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use
        for reading current file.
      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This
        program will automatically determine which format this file is.
        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check
        standard extension. Still fail, report error.
      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.
        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key
          (except ESCAPE).
        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.
        ESCAPE to terminate.
      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.
      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.

   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.
      Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.
      pressing RETURN: show image.
        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text
        mode.
      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do
        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.
      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.
      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.
        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).
        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).
        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).
        True Color: save as 24-bit image.

        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program
        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another
        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after
        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change
        directory to what you want. Then,

        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.
        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
                      (filename under bar).


  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.

  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,
     the performance is poor.

  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :
       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...

     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):
       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster
       (No one is better for true 24bits image)

  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.

  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested

     I need your suggestion to improve this program.

      ?Huh? Okay, so I'm not Eric Molas, but even if that _is_ how he
feels about life, I disagree with it.

      Life, to me, is definitely NOT meaningless; it has precisely the
purpose and meaning I choose to give it. I go on living because I _like_
living; if I needed any further reason, I'd be free - completely free! -
to pick any reason that suited me. That freedom can be almost
intoxicating; it's probably the closest I've ever been to a 'religious'
experience. I'm *very* glad I am an atheist; I wouldn't be anything
else.

      Not unless, in explaining your own subjective experience, you also
try to convert him or proselytize. Merely explaining the effects you
personally experience religion as having on you, is not ""infectious"".
Not unless Eric is paranoid, that is. ;->

      Whatever floats your goat. You sound happy enough; that's fairly
much all that matters, right?

      Erh... Pardon, but it strikes me that sentence sounds reversible.

      ""Empty spot""? ""God-shaped hole""? I hear such things a lot from
theists; never quite did understand what they were talking about.
I have no such 'emptiness' or 'hole'. Maybe some others do, I wouldn't
know; but I don't, and if I did, I'd seek help about it. Doesn't sound
like a mentally healthy situation at all, walking around with a 'hole'
in oneself.

      Well, not having written that original post, I don't know if it
was intended to be interpreted in such a way; but, having reread it

	Do I have to be the one to say it?

	DON'T BE SO STUPID AS TO LEAVE YOUR HELMET ON THE SEAT WHERE IT CAN
	FALL DOWN AND GO BOOM!

	That kind of fall is what the helmet is designed to protect against.
If you fall with the helmet on and you hit the same spot the helmet landed
on during the drop, the helmet may not protect your head as well as it was
intended to do.  Conservative rec.moto'ers will recommend that you replace
the helmet.  If you want to be sure that it will protect you adequately, you
should.

	HELMETS GO ON THE GROUND, ON A TABLE, ON A CHAIR, ON A SHELF, OR ON
	ANY OTHER SURFACE THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY
	WILL NOT EASILY BE KNOCKED DOWN.

	Jeezus.  My new Shoei would be $340 to replace.  You think I'm going

Actually, this part was really interesting.  It turns out that the mask is
custom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a
piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face
and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic
wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a
plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12
minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the
goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves
padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  
John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.

I think you would lose your money. Julius was actually rather tall

  OK, Doug is right, it would be obstruction of justice, blah blah blah,
BUT, saying ""I forgot"" is a lie, which is just as bad from a moral point
of view _IF_ you think ""lawfulness"" is a good in and of itself (which 
admittedly most people do not.)  But there's an even better way out of this.
PROVIDED the government is prosecuting you criminally, you can probably
plead the fifth amendmeent and thus LEGALLY avoid revealing your key.  The
government cannot demand information from a criminal defendant which ""may
tend to incriminate"" that defendant.  Though this has never been applied
in the cryptography context (at least as far as I can tell) it seems an
obvious application to me.  

 This may be a common suggestion in this group, but if it's not (I'm new
here) I'd love to hear what people have to say about it.  Since I don't
really read this group (and since the subject matter is more legal than

472,"Hi !

I am using Xview 3.0 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board
from Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. I am having some problems
utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.

I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use
to display live video. My video input is 24 bit color.

The problem is that my top level frame created as
	frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULL,FRAME,NULL);
seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.

I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits.
I tried using the following Xlib code :

XVisualInfo visual_info;
int depth = 24;
Colormap colormap;
XSetWindowAttributes attribs;
unsigned long valuemask = 0;
Window *win;
Xv_opaque frame;

win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID);
XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);

/* So far so good */

colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);

/* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */

attribs.colormap = colormap;
valuemask |= CWColormap;
XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs);
XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);


Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth
and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?

Thanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via
email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.

Thanks again,

What is the deal with the IDE transfer rates?  Is anybody getting throughput
anywhere close to the platter->controller rate?  I haven't seen anything
even close to the 5MB/sec limit of the IDE interface.  These drives are 1:1
(non-interleaved), aren't they?

Here are the rates I get:

1) sequential read (MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read 64-sector
                    blocks sequentially from outside (first) track inward)

                     8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                     --------    ---------
   MAXTOR LXT340:    860KB/sec   976KB/sec
   QUANTUM LPS240:   862KB/sec   887KB/sec

2) disk buffer read (same C program, but re-reads the same block repeatedly
                     so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive)

                     8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                     --------    ---------
   MAXTOR LXT340:   1046KB/sec  1212KB/sec
   QUANTUM LPS240:  1015KB/sec  1276KB/sec

3) CORETEST V2.7 transfer rate (seems to agree with (2) above)

                     8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                     --------    ---------
   MAXTOR LXT340:   1051KB/sec  1224KB/sec
   QUANTUM LPS240:  1026KB/sec  1298KB/sec

I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM LPS240AT product manual and it goes
into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter,
through the controller, and out the IDE interface.  Nowhere do I see
anything like ""after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed
they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host""
(even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent
quotes from the manual:

  ""Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of
   3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum.""  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec
   maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87
   sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)

  ""Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected
   'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of
   data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.""  (I take
   this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)

  ""For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer
   RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface
   IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,
   while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers""
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the
requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess
you could call that a cache :-|).

So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a
measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???

So?  Look in the trunk some time.  Heck - look at the dash.  That
funny thing attached with a quick-release is a gun.  The ones in the
trunk are ""better"".  (I don't have numbers for Chicago, but
Philadelphia police cars carried multiple automatic weapons and
thousands of rounds as standard issue in the 60s.)

What is the nature of this disadvantage?  If the cop can shoot, 6
rounds will do the job against a single opponent (especially since the
cop has guaranteed backup).  If the ""gang member"" can shoot, the extra
rounds don't help.  The only time this difference can matter is if
neither can shoot, and cops aren't supposed to be throwing lead around
like that.

BTW - most cops carry multiple guns.  You're not supposed to know
about the second, third, and so on.

>I have been at a shooting range where
>gang members were ""practicing"" shooting.

How do ""we"" know that they were gang members and not undercover cops
or even law-abiding menacing minorities.  BTW - Why the sneer quotes?

They were actually practicing
>taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target
>and they weren't doing too badly either.

Then the extra rounds won't make any difference, so why is it an issue?

that the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's
revelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the
Church that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant
ludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance

totally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable
views about other human beings. 
	now the question is this: were the first Christians just as
weird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine ""Fall of the
Church"" happen within one generation. It certainly did'nt have to
wait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so,
wha does  this say about God's promise to always support the Church.
It's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church
not being an organization at me. It's a community or it is nothing,
and it was the early communities that were weird. The institional
church was a model of sanity by comparison.
	I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to
this entirely serious issue. I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants
with their ""soul alone with Jesus"" approach, but for we who see the
""ecclesia"" as a ""koinoia"" over time and space, the weird early
Christians are a problem.

[This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants
have a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  ""The soul
alone with God"" is certainly important for Protestants, but it's by no
means the whole story.

I have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out,
Protestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because we
believe that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant
mythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or
more likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion,
starting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated
power during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it
earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept
the theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including
such items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of
Reformers such as Luther and Calvin, you'll find Church Fathers such
as Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you'll find many
Protestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was
""wierd"".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don't
much want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked at
recently -- that's the question of whether one can really think of
Augustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views
on Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to
Protestant thought.)

One thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology.
There are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What
concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We
see every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there's good
reason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than
that.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there's good reason to
think that many Christians were happily married.  I can't help
suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and
sane people that we do now.  I think there's also a certain level of
""revisionism"" active in history at the moment.  I don't mean that
they're manufacturing things out of whole cloth.  But don't you think

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for
argument's sake, define ""rushed"" as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below
expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I
tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but
I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are
any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can
look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers
would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but
actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  

Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", although
there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was
given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what
you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the
next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at
age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,
and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was
performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being ""rushed"";
Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have
been less likely to give up on him.

Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But

And thus, we come to one of the true beauties of baseball; these things, along
with many others will never be separated. Almost *everything* in baseball is
situational and interdependent. This is what allows us to carry on all the
arguments that we have. If everything could be explained and balanced on a
statistical basis, none of the wonder and mystery would be left. Why we might
have to resort to just going out the ballyard and enjoy the game itself.

	Hmmmm, why do I get the feeling that this is gonna start one of
those endless threads 'Mac Vs Win"" and might even end up as ""OS/2 Vs Win"".
Well, I dont know if Windows is a mature OS, if I have seen one (in which
case that has to be X-Windows :) ), but dont be so quick to judge... 
First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try
to use plain vanilla DOS. There are _lots_ of very nice commercial and
shareware packages/utilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself
thought possible :)... For example, Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (a replace-
ment for ProgMan) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will
even change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, FileMan
does that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now Mac doesnt do
that, huh? :) )... And the list goes on and on... Now, Windows _is_ kinda
hard to finetune, boost and configure, but thats trhe price to pay for not
paying $$$ to get a Mac or an OS/2 capable machine (an entirely differet
story ...)... On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's icons
not correspnding to the files themselves, well they are not supposed to :)..
PM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager... Modify your 
settings to have FM as your shell and not PM, or get a couple of utilities
from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel'... I dont wanna get in the
discussion which is a better system: Mac's are good in their own way -- they
are _different_ not better or worse than Win PCs-- (actually I am writing
this from a Mac lab as a user assistant - so dont think I am partial to Win:) )
By all means check out the stuff in cica (ftp to ftp.cica.indiana.edu under
the pub/pc/win3 subdir user: anonymous), or wait for StarTrek (Mac's OS on

I would go further: if a couple are unwilling to have their commitment
publicly witnessed and recorded, that's prima facie evidence that the
commitment isn't really there.

493,"Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a ""boxer"" type fan by installing
a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow of
small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4
uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working
voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is
usually required to experimentally determine the best size
capacitor for a given application.

For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.
It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is
exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.  I wish I knew who
made the fans for Radio Shack.

Moreover, the BATF has admitted having agents in the compound, and as
far as I have been able to ascertain, those agents were still in the
compound when the first shots were fired.  For all we know, these two
people may BE the agents, who would certainly be unlikely to stay around
and ""cook"" with the faithful...

Assuming the two people in question were even in the compound at all.

Maybe I sound paranoid, but I watched Janet Reno last night harping on
how much David Koresh was a big, bad child abuser, and I kept wondering 
why she -- much less BATF -- wanted us to infer that she had any 
jurisdiction over such accusations in the first place.

I'm POSITIVE that the ""sealed warrant"" is not for child abuse.  What was
it for?  Peobably weapons violations.  Janet Reno didn't say WORD ONE
last night about weapons violations.  Why?  Because she knows that such
a case is no longer believable?

I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout
back in the 1960s. The issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the
same. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who
think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the
only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has
been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have
survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts
haven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that
scouting is still worth fighting for.

camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing
